# Config Governance Fix: Scope Across All Variant Files

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-20 (v1.1.0) · 2026-06-19 (v1.0.0) |
| **Objective** | Capture the planning discipline for (a) correctly scoping a security/governance config-defect fix across variant files, and (b) verifying an issue's literal-assertion PREMISE against current HEAD before encoding it as a CI guard |
| **Outcome** | v1.0.0: plan corrected to fix ALL variant files plus a CI guard. v1.1.0: a `jq` premise check showed an issue's prescribed `enforcement==active`-over-all-4-files guard was factually wrong (on-disk state is `evaluate,active,evaluate,active` by design) and would have been red-on-day-one; corrected to a per-file expected-value map |
| **Verification** | verified-local for the premise-check technique (the `jq` premise verification WAS run during planning and confirmed `evaluate,active,evaluate,active`). The proposed enforcement-drift guard / CI wiring is **unverified** (planning only — not implemented or CI-run). GitHub-API IDs and bypass semantics from v1.0.0 also NOT confirmed against live `gh api` |
| **History** | `config-governance-fix-scope-all-variant-files.history` (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0) |

## When to Use

- Planning a fix for a security/governance finding (branch protection, rulesets, IAM policy, OPA, k8s admission config) that cites one or two specific config files by path and line.
- The repo keeps multiple variants of the same config — e.g. an enforcing `*-active.json` vs a baseline `*-evaluate`, or per-environment copies — and an apply script chooses which variant is deployed.
- The only existing "test surface" for a config is syntax validation (JSON parse, YAML lint), so a defective value can silently regress with no functional test catching it.
- A fix adds a review/approval requirement and you need to decide whether an existing `bypass_actors` entry already mitigates a solo-author self-approval deadlock.
- You are about to rely on governance-API numeric IDs (actor IDs, integration IDs) or bypass semantics pulled from existing JSON or a KB note, without confirming them against the live API.
- **(v1.1.0)** An issue body or its embedded fix sketch prescribes a *literal* blanket assertion over a set of named config files (e.g. "guard that all four ruleset files have `enforcement == "active"`") and you are about to encode it as a CI guard — run the assertion against current HEAD first; the premise may be wrong.
- **(v1.1.0)** A repo deliberately keeps a two-form split of the same config (a base/`evaluate` form and an `*-active.json`/enforcing form) with different per-file intended values, so a single blanket equality check is the wrong invariant and a per-file expected-value map is required.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Grep the ENTIRE config dir for the cited field — not just the files the issue named.
grep -n required_approving_review_count configs/github/*.json
# -> reveals the same `0` in org-ruleset.json AND org-ruleset-active.json,
#    repo-ruleset.json AND repo-ruleset-active.json.

# 2. Find which variant the apply script actually deploys (the enforcing path).
grep -nE 'active|--active|enforce' tools/github/apply-repo-rulesets.sh
# -> the script selects the `-active.json` file for --active/enforcing mode,
#    a file the issue never named.

# 3. After fixing, add a CI regression guard (jq assertion) so the value can't silently regress.
jq -e '.rules[] | select(.type=="pull_request")
       | .parameters.required_approving_review_count >= 1' configs/github/org-ruleset-active.json

# 4. Before adding an approval requirement, inspect existing bypass_actors to avoid a redundant actor.
jq '.bypass_actors' configs/github/org-ruleset-active.json
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Treat the cited paths as a starting point, not the scope.** A finding that says
   `configs/github/org-ruleset.json:21` and `repo-ruleset.json` is reporting where the author
   *looked*, not necessarily everywhere the defect lives.
2. **Grep the whole config directory for the offending field** (`grep -n <field> configs/<area>/*`).
   In this session that surfaced the same `required_approving_review_count: 0` in
   `org-ruleset-active.json:21` and `repo-ruleset-active.json:17` — neither named by the issue.
3. **Determine which variant is actually deployed.** Read the apply/deploy script. Here
   `tools/github/apply-repo-rulesets.sh` selects the `-active.json` file for `--active`/enforcing
   mode. The enforcing path uses a file the issue never named, so fixing only the cited files
   leaves the gap live whenever the ruleset is activated.
4. **Fix every variant that carries the defective value**, prioritizing the enforcing one.
5. **Add a CI regression guard when the only test surface is syntax validation.** A jq assertion
   (`required_approving_review_count >= 1`) in CI prevents a silent regression back to the
   defective state — JSON-parse validation alone would not catch it.
6. **Check existing `bypass_actors` before adding an approval requirement.** A `pull_request`-mode
   admin/Integration bypass actor already present can mitigate the solo-author self-approval
   deadlock that the `ci-cd-ruleset-bootstrap-deadlock` KB warns about — do not add a redundant
   actor.
7. **Record planning-time assumptions you could not verify as explicit risks** (see Failed
   Attempts) rather than presenting them as facts.

### Verify the issue premise before planning to it (v1.1.0)

> **Warning — partially unverified.** The *premise-verification technique* below is
> **verified-local**: the `jq` premise check WAS actually run during this planning session and
> confirmed the on-disk state `evaluate,active,evaluate,active`. The *proposed enforcement-drift
> guard and its CI wiring are UNVERIFIED* — they were designed at planning time only, never
> implemented, never run in CI. Treat the guard snippet as a proposal, not a tested artifact.

When an issue (or its embedded fix sketch) prescribes a **literal assertion over named files** —
here, issue #309 asserted PR #177 flipped the two BASE files (`repo-ruleset.json:4`,
`org-ruleset.json:4`) from `evaluate` to `active` and prescribed a guard looping **all four**
ruleset files asserting `enforcement == "active"` — do **not** adopt it on faith.

1. **Run the literal assertion against current HEAD with a cheap `jq`/grep one-liner.**
   ```bash
   for f in repo-ruleset repo-ruleset-active org-ruleset org-ruleset-active; do
     printf '%s: %s\n' "$f" "$(jq -r .enforcement "configs/github/$f.json")"
   done
   # Actual on-disk state -> evaluate, active, evaluate, active
   ```
2. **Compare to the premise.** The issue claimed all four should be `active`. On disk the two
   BASE files (`*-ruleset.json`) are intentionally `"evaluate"` and only the `*-active.json`
   variants are `"active"`. The prescribed blanket guard would have **failed on day one against a
   correct repo** (red CI, no actual defect).
3. **Confirm the split is intentional, not drift.** `configs/github/canonical-checks.md:58-62`
   documents the two-form split as design (base/evaluate form vs active/enforcing form, with
   different required-check context strings). A blanket `== "active"` check encodes the wrong
   invariant.
4. **Encode the CORRECT invariant: a per-file expected-enforcement map** (catches drift in BOTH
   directions — an active config silently downgraded to evaluate, AND a base config silently
   upgraded to active). This is strictly stronger than the issue's blanket check. *(Proposed —
   unverified.)*
5. **Wire it per `ci-hygiene-and-validation-gates` Pattern 2**: add the value-assertion to an
   EXISTING static-check job (not a new workflow), keep echoes ASCII-only, and put the logic in a
   reusable `just` recipe that CI calls so it lives in one place. Follow
   `architecture-executable-convention-guard-pattern` for the prose-invariant → tested-blocking-
   check shape: loud collision-free failure, and two-sided verification (clean PASS on a correct
   tree + synthetic FAIL on a deliberately corrupted copy).

### Quick Reference

```bash
# STEP 0 (CHEAP, ALWAYS DO THIS): verify the issue's literal premise against HEAD.
for f in repo-ruleset repo-ruleset-active org-ruleset org-ruleset-active; do
  printf '%s: %s\n' "$f" "$(jq -r .enforcement "configs/github/$f.json")"
done
# Expected/intended -> evaluate, active, evaluate, active  (NOT all "active")

# PROPOSED guard (UNVERIFIED): assert each file against its INTENDED per-file value.
# Two-sided drift detection: base must stay evaluate, active must stay active.
declare -A want=(
  [repo-ruleset]=evaluate  [repo-ruleset-active]=active
  [org-ruleset]=evaluate   [org-ruleset-active]=active
)
fail=0
for f in "${!want[@]}"; do
  got=$(jq -r .enforcement "configs/github/$f.json")
  if [ "$got" != "${want[$f]}" ]; then
    echo "DRIFT: configs/github/$f.json enforcement=$got expected=${want[$f]}"
    fail=1
  fi
done
[ "$fail" -eq 0 ] || exit 1
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Scope the fix to only the cited files | Plan would have edited only `org-ruleset.json` and `repo-ruleset.json` as the issue named | A whole-dir grep found the same `0` in `org-ruleset-active.json:21` and `repo-ruleset-active.json:17`; the apply script deploys the `-active.json` variant | Grep the entire config dir for the field before scoping; the deployed variant may not be the file the issue names |
| Assume JSON-syntax validation is enough coverage | Relied on existing `just ruleset-validate` (JSON parse) as the test surface | Syntax validation never asserts the *value*; the defective `0` could silently regress unnoticed | Add a jq value-assertion (`>= 1`) CI guard when the only test surface is syntax validation |
| Add a new bypass actor to avoid the self-approval deadlock | Considered adding an admin/Integration bypass to unblock a solo author after requiring approvals | An existing `pull_request`-mode bypass actor already mitigated the deadlock | Inspect existing `bypass_actors` first; do not add a redundant actor |
| Trust governance-API IDs from existing JSON / KB | Took `actor_id: 1` (OrganizationAdmin), `5` (RepositoryRole admin), `49699333` (Integration), `integration_id: 15368` (GitHub Actions app) at face value | Never confirmed against live `gh api`; numeric IDs and app IDs can differ per org/install | Verify governance-API IDs against the live API before relying on them in a security fix |
| Assume bypass-actor merge semantics | Assumed a `pull_request`-mode bypass lets an admin author merge a self-PR the review requirement would block | Never empirically tested against GitHub's live behavior — it is the deadlock-mitigation claim and remains unverified | Empirically verify bypass behavior against live GitHub before relying on it to resolve a deadlock |
| Cite exact line numbers in the plan | Referenced `org:21`, `repo:17` from the current checkout | Line numbers drift as files change; they are checkout-relative | Reference the field name and file, not just line numbers; re-grep at apply time |
| Adopt issue sketch's blanket `enforcement==active` guard over all 4 files (v1.1.0) | Issue #309 prescribed a guard looping all four ruleset files asserting `enforcement == "active"`, claiming PR #177 flipped the two base files | A `jq -r .enforcement` over all four files showed the on-disk state is `evaluate, active, evaluate, active`; the two base files are `evaluate` by design (`canonical-checks.md:58-62`), so the guard would be red on day one against a correct repo | Run the literal assertion against HEAD before adopting it; encode a per-file expected-value map (catches drift both directions), not a blanket equality check |

## Results & Parameters

**Concrete evidence from the session (issue #178 — branch protection requires zero approving reviews):**

```text
Field:          required_approving_review_count
Cited by issue: configs/github/org-ruleset.json:21, repo-ruleset.json
Grep revealed:  same `0` ALSO in org-ruleset-active.json:21, repo-ruleset-active.json:17
Apply script:   tools/github/apply-repo-rulesets.sh selects *-active.json for --active mode
                => enforcing path uses a file the issue never named
Guard added:    jq assertion required_approving_review_count >= 1 in CI
Bypass check:   existing pull_request-mode admin/Integration bypass actor already mitigates
                the ci-cd-ruleset-bootstrap-deadlock solo-author self-approval risk
```

**Regression-guard snippet (copy-paste):**

```bash
for f in configs/github/org-ruleset-active.json configs/github/repo-ruleset-active.json; do
  jq -e '[.rules[]? | select(.type=="pull_request")
         | .parameters.required_approving_review_count]
         | all(. >= 1)' "$f" >/dev/null \
    || { echo "REGRESSION: $f has required_approving_review_count < 1"; exit 1; }
done
```

**Unverified assumptions recorded as risks (Failed-or-unverified):**

- `bypass_actors` numeric IDs (`actor_id: 1` OrganizationAdmin, `5` RepositoryRole admin,
  `49699333` Integration, `integration_id: 15368` GitHub Actions app) taken from existing JSON +
  KB note; NOT confirmed against live `gh api`.
- Bypass-actor semantics (a `pull_request`-mode bypass lets an admin author merge a self-PR the
  review requirement would block) NOT empirically tested against live GitHub.
- Line numbers (`org:21`, `repo:17`) are checkout-relative and can drift.
- `just ruleset-validate` requires `gh` auth + network; not runnable in a plan-time sandbox.

**Concrete evidence from the v1.1.0 session (issue #309 — "ruleset configs must stay enforcement=active"):**

```text
Issue premise:  PR #177 flipped repo-ruleset.json:4 and org-ruleset.json:4 from
                "evaluate" to "active"; prescribed guard loops ALL FOUR files
                asserting enforcement == "active".
Premise check:  jq -r .enforcement over all four files (RUN during planning) ->
                repo-ruleset.json         = evaluate   (base form, by design)
                repo-ruleset-active.json  = active
                org-ruleset.json          = evaluate   (base form, by design)
                org-ruleset-active.json   = active
Verdict:        Premise WRONG. Blanket enforcement=="active" guard would be
                red-on-day-one against a correct repo.
Design source:  configs/github/canonical-checks.md:58-62 documents the two-form
                split (base/evaluate vs active/enforcing, different required-check
                context strings) as intentional.
Corrected plan: per-file expected-enforcement map (evaluate for base, active for
                *-active) -> catches drift in BOTH directions, strictly stronger
                than the issue's blanket check. (PROPOSED — not implemented/CI-run.)
Verification:   premise-verification technique = verified-local (jq WAS run);
                proposed guard + CI wiring = UNVERIFIED (planning only).
```

**v1.1.0 unverified assumptions / unverified reliances recorded as risks:**

- Assumed `jq` is preinstalled on GitHub `ubuntu-latest` runners — relied on without a CI run in
  THIS repo's image confirming it (it is standard on `ubuntu-latest` but not asserted here).
- Line numbers cited at planning time (`justfile:679/693/695`, `ci.yml:10/21-25/44-48`,
  `canonical-checks.md:58-62`) were read at planning time and can drift before implementation —
  re-read / re-grep at apply time.
- The proposed per-file enforcement-drift guard and its `just`+CI wiring are **unverified**: never
  implemented, never run in CI, no clean-PASS / synthetic-FAIL two-sided check executed. Only the
  on-disk `jq` premise verification was actually run (and confirmed
  `evaluate,active,evaluate,active`).

**Related skills (apply/debug rulesets + the guard/CI patterns this plan leans on):**
`github-branch-protection-org-standardize`, `ci-cd-ruleset-bootstrap-deadlock`,
`github-ruleset-pr-blocked-diagnose-missing-check-requirements`,
`architecture-executable-convention-guard-pattern` (prose invariant → tested blocking check; loud
collision-free failure; two-sided clean-PASS + synthetic-FAIL verification),
`ci-hygiene-and-validation-gates` (Pattern 2: value-assertion step in an EXISTING static-check job,
ASCII-only echoes, reusable `just` recipe called by CI).
