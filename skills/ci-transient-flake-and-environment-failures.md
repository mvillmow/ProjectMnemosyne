# CI Transient Flake and Environment Failures

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-07 |
| **Objective** | Diagnose and resolve CI failures that are transient network flakes (Trivy install, lychee link-check) or environment-only (passes locally, fails in GHA) — without reaching for banned suppressions. |
| **Outcome** | Verified across ProjectAgamemnon (#368), ProjectOdyssey (#5347), ProjectOdyssey local repro, and ProjectMyrmidons (#350). |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |

## When to Use

- A GitHub Actions job fails non-deterministically and a fresh run (rerun or new push) resolves it with zero code change. Common signatures:
  - **Trivy install flake**: `aquasecurity/trivy info found version: X.Y.Z` immediately followed by `##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.`, with the prior `pip-audit` (or equivalent) step clean.
  - **Lychee link-check flake**: HTTP 403 on `claude.ai` / `platform.claude.com` / `code.claude.com` (bot-blocking), or `os error 104` (connection reset) on `contributor-covenant.org` and similar community sites.
- Tests pass locally 100% but fail consistently in CI, and you need to replicate the three CI conditions (cold pixi cache + UID mismatch + no-TTY) simultaneously.
- A doctor / health-check / preflight script (`scripts/doctor.sh`, `just doctor`) exits 1 in CI because it validates developer-local resources (`.git/hooks/`, SSH keys, local config) absent on GHA runners.
- You are tempted to add `|| true` or `continue-on-error: true` to silence a flake — STOP, those are policy-banned.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# --- Transient flake: rerun first, no code change ---
unset GITHUB_TOKEN GH_TOKEN                       # let gh use runner auth chain
gh run rerun <RUN_ID> --repo "$ORG/$REPO" --failed
# Fallback: empty commit retriggers a fresh run
git commit --allow-empty -m "ci: retrigger CI to clear transient flake" && git push

# --- Lychee bot-403 / reset: add regex patterns to .lycheeignore ---
cat >> .lycheeignore << 'EOF'
claude\.ai
platform\.claude\.com
code\.claude\.com
contributor-covenant\.org
EOF

# --- Reproduce CI-only failure locally: all 3 conditions at once ---
podman compose down -v                            # cold pixi cache
USER_ID=1001 GROUP_ID=1001 podman compose up -d   # CI runner UID (image build UID is 1000)
USER_ID=1001 GROUP_ID=1001 podman compose exec -T <service> bash -c \
  "cd /workspace && <test command>"               # -T = no TTY

# --- Doctor script: guard developer-local checks in CI ---
if [[ "${CI:-}" == "true" ]]; then
    warn "<check name> skipped in CI" "<reason: dev-local only>"
    return
fi
```

### Detailed Steps

#### A. Transient Trivy install.sh exit-1

1. **Match the signature exactly.** The trivy install step's log MUST end with the `found version` line (no download bar, no checksum, no tar-extraction error) followed within ~0.4s by the runner error:

   ```text
   ##[group]Run TRIVY_VERSION=0.58.1
   TRIVY_VERSION=0.58.1
   curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh \
     | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin "v${TRIVY_VERSION}"
   trivy --version
   shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}
   ##[endgroup]
   aquasecurity/trivy info checking GitHub for tag 'v0.58.1'
   aquasecurity/trivy info found version: 0.58.1 for v0.58.1/Linux/64bit
   ##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.
   ```

   If the log includes a progress bar, checksum-mismatch, or extraction error, this is NOT the same flake — investigate normally.
2. **Confirm the prior step passed.** A clean `pip-audit` immediately before rules out a job-wide environment issue.
3. **Rerun the failed jobs.** `gh run rerun <RUN_ID> --failed`. Unset `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` if your shell has a PAT lacking `actions:write`.
4. **If rerun isn't possible** (workflow changed since the run), push an empty commit to retrigger.
5. **Only investigate if multiple reruns fail.** A repeat after two clean reruns implies a real problem (GitHub raw-content outage, version yank).
6. **Durable follow-up (separate issue, don't block the PR):** replace curl-pipe-to-sh with the official action, which has retry semantics:

   ```yaml
   - name: Run Trivy
     uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v<X>
     with:
       scan-type: fs
       format: sarif
       output: trivy-results.sarif
   ```

#### B. Lychee link-check bot-403 / connection reset

1. **Identify the failing URLs** in the CI log:

   ```text
   [ERROR] https://claude.ai/code — Status 403 (Forbidden)
   [ERROR] https://contributor-covenant.org/... — Connection reset (os error 104)
   ```

2. **Classify each failure**:

   | Failure Type | URL Pattern | Root Cause | Action |
   |-------------|-------------|------------|--------|
   | HTTP 403 | `claude.ai`, `platform.claude.com`, `code.claude.com` | Anthropic URLs return 403 to automated bots (lychee user-agent) | Add to `.lycheeignore` |
   | Connection reset (os error 104) | `contributor-covenant.org` | Intermittent server reset; site valid but unreliable from CI | Add to `.lycheeignore` |

3. **Add regex patterns to `.lycheeignore`** (project root). Patterns are regular expressions, not globs; escape literal dots with `\.`; a pattern matches any URL containing the substring; `#` starts a comment:

   ```text
   # Ignore Claude/Anthropic URLs that return 403 to bots (valid URLs)
   claude\.ai
   platform\.claude\.com
   code\.claude\.com

   # Ignore external sites that intermittently reset connections (os error 104)
   contributor-covenant\.org
   ```

4. **Verify** — push to trigger CI, or run locally:

   ```bash
   lychee --config .lychee.toml "**/*.md" --exclude-path .pixi
   # or: pixi run lychee "**/*.md"
   ```

   `.lycheeignore` is read automatically by lychee — no explicit `.lychee.toml` reference needed.

#### C. Reproduce CI-only test failures locally

1. **Identify the three CI-specific conditions** that differ from local:
   - **Cold pixi cache**: CI creates fresh named volumes every run; locally volumes persist.
   - **UID mismatch**: CI runner typically uses UID 1001; container image is built with UID 1000.
   - **No TTY**: CI uses `podman compose exec -T` (the `-T` flag disables TTY).
2. **Confirm exact values from your CI config:**

   ```bash
   grep -r "USER_ID\|GROUP_ID\|uid\|user:" .github/workflows/
   grep -r "exec -T\|compose exec" .github/workflows/ justfile
   ```

3. **Delete all named volumes** (`podman compose down -v`), **start with CI UID** (`USER_ID=1001 GROUP_ID=1001 podman compose up -d`), then **run the failing test with `-T`**.
4. **If still not reproducing**, add CI env vars (`CI=true GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`) and check runner resource limits / filesystem (overlay vs native).
5. **Read the FULL stack trace**, not just the summary. `execution crashed` is a symptom; the real cause (permission error from UID mismatch, missing cache dir, segfault) is in the trace. `fortify_fail_abort` / `__fortify_fail` points to a buffer overflow or permission violation.

#### D. Doctor/health-check script CI guard

1. **Identify the failing `check_*()` function** referencing developer-local artifacts (`.git/hooks/`, `~/.ssh/`, pre-commit install state).
2. **Understand the CI context.** GitHub Actions sets `CI=true` on all runners. `${CI:-}` safely handles set and unset cases under `set -u`.
3. **Add the guard at the TOP of the check function**, before any file-existence tests:

   ```bash
   check_hooks() {
       section "Check N: Git hooks"

       local hook_src="${REPO_ROOT}/hooks/pre-commit"
       local hook_dst="${REPO_ROOT}/.git/hooks/pre-commit"

       if [[ ! -f "$hook_src" ]]; then
           warn "hooks/pre-commit source not found in repo"
           return
       fi

       # In CI there is no .git/hooks directory; skip this check.
       if [[ "${CI:-}" == "true" ]]; then
           warn "pre-commit hook check skipped in CI" "hooks are installed by developers locally"
           return
       fi

       if [[ ! -f "$hook_dst" ]]; then
           fail "pre-commit hook not installed" "Run: just install-hooks"
       elif [[ ! -x "$hook_dst" ]]; then
           fail "pre-commit hook not executable" "Run: chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit"
       else
           pass "pre-commit hook installed and executable"
       fi
   }
   ```

4. **Use `warn` not `pass`** for the skip message so CI logs show the check was intentionally skipped.
5. **Test locally** that the guard doesn't suppress the check in a normal shell, then **verify in CI** the job exits 0.

   Categories of checks needing CI guards: git hooks, SSH infrastructure, local config files, pre-commit install state, GPG signing setup, editor/IDE config.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Add `\|\| true` / `continue-on-error: true` to silence a flake | Suppress the failing Trivy or link-check step | Org-wide `forbid-suppressions` / `forbid-continue-on-error` guards reject the diff at lint time | Suppressions are policy-banned; never reach for them to mask a flake |
| Pin Trivy to a different version (thinking it was yanked) | Changed `0.58.1` → `0.57.x` | The same install.sh exit-1 reproduces on a fresh run; reverting then succeeds on rerun | The curl-pipe-to-sh transport is the variable, not the version. Don't churn version numbers. |
| Read `install.sh` source to find the failure path | Source-dived the upstream script | It writes nothing to stderr before exit 1; no log evidence to investigate | Without log evidence, source-diving is speculative — rerun first, investigate only if reruns reproduce |
| `--exclude-all-private` lychee flag | Tried excluding private/localhost URLs | Only skips private IP ranges and localhost, not bot-blocked external URLs | Use targeted `.lycheeignore` regex for external 403s |
| `accept = [403]` in `.lychee.toml` | Globally accept 403 status | Too broad — would hide real broken links returning 403 | Prefer `.lycheeignore` for targeted exclusion; reserve `--accept` for codes you globally trust |
| Wait for intermittent resets to clear | Assumed `contributor-covenant.org` resets were transient | Resets consistently enough in CI to block every run | Add unreliable external gates to `.lycheeignore`; don't rely on their availability |
| Declare crash "non-reproducible locally" with warm cache + UID 1000 | 10 parallel agents ran the test locally; all passed | Warm cache + matching UID + TTY don't replicate CI | Never declare "passes locally" without identical conditions; replicate ALL three at once |
| Fix one CI condition at a time | Tried only cold cache, or only UID mismatch | Each condition alone may not trigger the crash; all three together are required | Replicate cold cache + UID mismatch + no-TTY simultaneously |
| Conclude "non-deterministic JIT flakiness" from the summary line | Read only `execution crashed`, not the full trace | The real cause (permission error) was in the stack trace | Always read the complete stack trace before forming a hypothesis |

## Results & Parameters

### Trivy flake — resolution commands

```bash
unset GITHUB_TOKEN GH_TOKEN
gh run rerun <RUN_ID> --repo "$ORG/$REPO" --failed
# fallback
git commit --allow-empty -m "ci: retrigger CI to clear trivy install flake" && git push
```

Signature features: job shell is `bash -e`; the `found version` line is the last informational line; the `##[error]` appears <0.4s later; no trivy/curl/sh error message; the prior dep-scanner step exited 0.

### Lychee — `.lycheeignore` entries

```text
claude\.ai
platform\.claude\.com
code\.claude\.com
contributor-covenant\.org
```

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `claude\.ai` | Any URL containing `claude.ai` |
| `platform\.claude\.com` | `https://platform.claude.com/...` |
| `contributor-covenant\.org` | Any `contributor-covenant.org` URL |

### CI environment conditions (Podman + pixi)

```bash
USER_ID=1001   # CI runner UID (image build UID is 1000)
GROUP_ID=1001  # CI runner GID
# Named pixi-cache volumes are fresh each run; compose exec uses -T (no TTY)
```

| Condition | Local Default | CI Default | Replicate Locally |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Pixi cache | Warm (persistent) | Cold (fresh) | `podman compose down -v` |
| Container UID | 1000 | 1001 | `USER_ID=1001 GROUP_ID=1001 podman compose up -d` |
| TTY | Present | None (`-T`) | `podman compose exec -T` |
| CI env vars | Unset | `CI=true`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` | Add to exec command |

Expected: a previously "non-reproducible" crash reproduces 100% deterministically; the full trace reveals the real root cause.

### Doctor CI guard — environment reference

```bash
CI=true            # set automatically on all GitHub Actions runners
${CI:-}            # empty string if unset (safe under set -u)
if [[ "${CI:-}" == "true" ]]; then ...  # skip developer-local checks
```

`.git/hooks/` is absent on: GitHub Actions runners (all OS), GitLab shallow clones, any `git clone --depth=1` / `actions/checkout`, Docker-copied repos. It IS present after `pre-commit install`, on full clones, or in CI jobs that explicitly run `pre-commit install`.

## Verified On
