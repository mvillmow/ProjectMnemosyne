# Release Tag Drift: Re-cut the Tag on a Fixed Commit

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-16 |
| **Objective** | Diagnose why a `vX.Y.Z` tag existed but the package never reached PyPI, then re-cut the tag correctly so the Release workflow publishes. |
| **Outcome** | Successful — root cause was a tag-time version-currency drift guard failing the Release `test` job, which SKIPPED `build-and-publish`. Fixed `docs/MIGRATION.md` on main, then re-cut the tag on the fixed commit; the new Release run published to PyPI with attestations. |
| **Verification** | verified-ci — executed end-to-end; the re-triggered Release workflow passed all jobs incl. `build-and-publish`, and PyPI publish succeeded. |

## When to Use

- A `vX.Y.Z` tag exists, but PyPI has no matching release — yet main's regular push-CI is green.
- A linked failing CI run is the **Release** workflow with `headBranch` equal to a `vX.Y.Z` tag (a tag-triggered run), not a push to main.
- The Release `test` job failed and `build-and-publish` shows conclusion **skipped** — so the package is silently unpublished despite the tag existing.
- A "version-currency drift guard" test asserts a doc's "latest released version is **X.Y.Z**" line is not older than the newest `vX.Y.Z` tag, and the tag's own commit fails it (chicken-and-egg).
- You were told to "delete the tag and launch a new tag" and need to decide: re-create the same version on a fixed commit, or bump to the next patch.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Identify it's the Release workflow on the TAG, not main CI
gh run view <run-id> --json name,workflowName,headBranch,headSha,conclusion
#   -> name=Release, headBranch=v0.9.6  (a tag, not a branch)

# 2. Confirm only the drift test failed AND publish was SKIPPED (not failed)
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs -q '.jobs[] | "\(.conclusion // .status)  \(.name)"'
#   -> failure  test          (drift guard)
#   -> skipped  build-and-publish   <-- package silently unpublished

# 3. Fix the doc on a NORMAL PR branch off main, verify locally
git checkout -b <issue>-fix-migration-version main
# edit docs/MIGRATION.md: bump "latest released version is X.Y.Z" to match the tag;
# also refresh any stale "as of YYYY-MM-DD" date
pytest tests/unit/docs/test_version_currency.py   # must pass

# 4. PR per repo policy, signed commit, merge to MAIN first
git commit -S -m "docs(migration): bump version line to vX.Y.Z to clear release drift guard"
gh pr create --body "$(printf 'Fix release drift guard.\n\nCloses #<issue>\n')"
#   Do NOT pre-arm auto-merge; apply the GO label / let the review flow arm it.

# 5. After merge, sync main and note the FIXED commit SHA
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main
git rev-parse --short HEAD            # e.g. d3cef75  <- fixed commit

# 6. Delete the old tag (remote + local) and re-create on the FIXED commit
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z    # delete remote (outward-facing; confirm w/ user)
git tag -d vX.Y.Z                    # delete local -- BLOCKED by CC Safety Net; USER runs this
git tag -s vX.Y.Z <fixed-sha> -m "$(printf 'Release vX.Y.Z\n\nRe-cut on fixed commit <sha>: clears the version-currency drift guard that previously skipped the PyPI publish.')"
git push origin vX.Y.Z               # re-triggers Release on the FIXED commit

# 7. Watch the new Release run; verify build-and-publish is NO LONGER skipped
gh run watch <new-run-id> --exit-status

# 8. Verify PyPI is live (JSON index lags a few minutes; publish-step success is authoritative)
curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/<DistName>/<version>/json | head
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Identify the run is the Release workflow on the tag, not main CI.**
   `gh run view <id> --json name,workflowName,headBranch,headSha,conclusion`. A
   `headBranch` of `vX.Y.Z` means a tag-triggered Release run. Main's push-CI being
   green is a red herring — the drift guard only fails on the tag-triggered run
   because that run is the only context where the tag exists and the assertion
   `(doc_version) >= (latest_tag)` is evaluated against the new tag.

2. **Confirm the failure shape: drift test failed → publish SKIPPED.**
   `gh run view <id> --json jobs -q '.jobs[] | "\(.conclusion // .status)  \(.name)"'`.
   A failed `test` job causes the downstream `build-and-publish` job (which `needs: test`)
   to be **skipped**, not failed. So the package is silently unpublished even though the
   run's top-level conclusion looks like a plain test failure. Always check the
   `build-and-publish` job conclusion explicitly, not just the run conclusion.

3. **Fix the doc on a normal PR branch off main and verify locally.**
   Bump `docs/MIGRATION.md`'s "latest released version is **X.Y.Z**" line to match the
   tag, and refresh any stale "as of YYYY-MM-DD" date the same guard or a sibling test
   checks. Run `pytest tests/unit/docs/test_version_currency.py` and confirm it passes
   before opening the PR.

4. **Open a PR per repo policy (`Closes #N`), signed commit, and merge to main FIRST.**
   The fix MUST land on main before re-tagging. Re-tagging on the still-buggy main would
   reproduce the identical drift-guard failure. Do NOT pre-arm `gh pr merge --auto` — in
   repos that gate auto-merge behind a `state:implementation-go` (or equivalent) label,
   pre-arming trips the auto-merge-policy gate. Apply the GO label first or let the review
   flow arm it.

5. **Sync local main and capture the fixed commit SHA.**
   `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main`, then
   `git rev-parse --short HEAD` to record the merge commit (e.g. `d3cef75`). This is the
   commit the new tag must point at.

6. **Delete the old tag and re-create it on the fixed commit.**
   - `git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z` deletes the remote tag (outward-facing — confirm
     with the user before deleting a published tag).
   - `git tag -d vX.Y.Z` deletes the local tag — **CC Safety Net blocks `git tag -d`**;
     hand this to the user to run manually. You cannot override the hook even with
     in-conversation approval.
   - `git tag -s vX.Y.Z <fixed-sha> -m "<descriptive message>"` creates a signed annotated
     tag on the fixed commit, matching the repo's tag convention. Use a descriptive message
     that explains the re-cut, not a bare `Release vX.Y.Z`.
   - `git push origin vX.Y.Z` re-triggers the Release workflow on the fixed commit.

7. **Watch the new Release run and confirm publish actually ran.**
   `gh run watch <new-id> --exit-status`. Verify all jobs pass, especially that
   `build-and-publish` is no longer skipped. Confirm the version-check step prints the
   right version and the publish step uploaded (look for the sigstore attestation /
   "Publish to PyPI" step output).

8. **Verify PyPI is live.**
   `curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/<DistName>/<version>/json`. The PyPI JSON index lags a
   few minutes; the workflow's publish step succeeding with attestations is the
   authoritative "published" signal, not the JSON index appearing instantly.

### Gotchas

- **Tag-time drift guards are inherently chicken-and-egg.** The tag itself triggers the
  check that the tag's content fails. The only fix is land-on-main-then-recut — never
  recut-in-place on the buggy commit.
- **A failed Release `test` job SKIPS, not fails, `build-and-publish`.** The package is
  silently unpublished even though the tag exists and the run looks like an ordinary test
  failure. Check the `build-and-publish` job conclusion, not just the run conclusion.
- **Annotated/signed tags have a tag-object SHA distinct from the commit they point to.**
  `git rev-parse vX.Y.Z` returns the *tag object*. To get the underlying commit, use
  `git for-each-ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z --format='%(*objectname:short)'`.
- **"Delete the tag and launch a new tag" is ambiguous.** Clarify with the user whether to
  RE-CREATE the same version (premature/bad tag redo) or BUMP to the next patch. This
  changes which version you write into `MIGRATION.md`.
- **CC Safety Net blocks `git tag -d`, `git worktree remove --force`, and `git checkout --`.**
  Hand these to the user to run manually; the hook cannot be overridden even with
  in-conversation approval.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Assumed the linked failing CI run was main's push-CI | Main push-CI was actually green; the failure was the tag-triggered Release workflow | Check `workflowName` + `headBranch` on the run — a `vX.Y.Z` headBranch means a tag-triggered release, not a branch |
| 2 | Considered re-cutting the tag immediately on current main | Current main still had the buggy `MIGRATION.md`; re-tag would fail the drift guard identically | The doc fix must merge to main BEFORE re-tagging; the re-tag must point at the fixed commit |
| 3 | `gh pr merge --auto --squash` armed immediately on the fix PR | Tripped the repo's auto-merge-policy gate (auto-merge only allowed after the `state:implementation-go` label) | Don't pre-arm auto-merge; apply the GO label first or let the review flow arm it |
| 4 | `git tag -d v0.9.6` run by the assistant | Blocked by CC Safety Net (destructive tag deletion) | Hand `git tag -d` / `git worktree remove --force` / `git checkout --` to the user to run manually |

## Results & Parameters

**Diagnostic commands (copy-paste):**

```bash
# Was it the Release workflow on a tag?
gh run view <run-id> --json name,workflowName,headBranch,headSha,conclusion
# Expected on failure: name=Release, headBranch=v0.9.6

# Did the drift test fail and publish skip?
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs -q '.jobs[] | "\(.conclusion // .status)  \(.name)"'
# Expected: "failure  test"  and  "skipped  build-and-publish"

# Underlying commit of an annotated/signed tag (NOT the tag-object SHA):
git for-each-ref refs/tags/v0.9.6 --format='%(*objectname:short)'
```

**The drift-guard assertion that fails (illustrative):**

```text
tests/unit/docs/test_version_currency.py::test_migration_md_version_does_not_trail_latest_git_tag
assert (0, 9, 5) >= (0, 9, 6)   # MIGRATION.md says 0.9.5, newest tag is v0.9.6  -> False -> FAIL
```

**Re-cut sequence (verified, with real SHAs from the session):**

```bash
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.9.6                 # delete remote tag
git tag -d v0.9.6                                 # local delete — USER runs (CC Safety Net blocks)
git tag -s v0.9.6 d3cef75 -m "$(printf 'Release v0.9.6\n\nRe-cut on fixed commit d3cef75: clears the version-currency drift guard that skipped the PyPI publish on the original tag at f32f1ed.')"
git push origin v0.9.6                            # re-trigger Release on the fixed commit
gh run watch <new-run-id> --exit-status
curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/<DistName>/0.9.6/json
```

**Expected outcome:** the re-triggered Release run passes all jobs including
`build-and-publish` (no longer skipped), the publish step uploads to PyPI with sigstore
attestations, and the package version becomes installable once the PyPI index catches up.
