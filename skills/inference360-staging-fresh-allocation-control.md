# Inference360 Fresh-Allocation Staging Control Validation

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-26 |
| **Objective** | Run Inference360 staging/control tests and deterministic IFM corruption repros through fresh H200 Slurm allocations without reusing existing model endpoints. |
| **Outcome** | Successful local end-to-end cluster/control validation, plus issue 257 evidence showing the converted IFM 4B path corrupts under vLLM seed 42 while HF/native XLLM and compatible SGLang comparison still require another runtime/cluster. PR 279 merged the runbook and tooling support after CI passed. |
| **Verification** | verified-local. The live H200 Slurm control/API workflows ran locally; PR 279 CI passed and merged for the checked-in docs, smoke tests, and helper updates. The decisive cross-cluster comparison remains pending. |
| **History** | [changelog](./inference360-staging-fresh-allocation-control.history) |

## When to Use

- The user asks to validate Inference360 staging, control API, or lifecycle behavior for IFM, multi-model vLLM, or similar H200 Slurm services.
- Existing endpoints or jobs are already running, but the user has not explicitly said allocation reuse is acceptable.
- You need evidence that a staging/control run allocated a fresh Slurm nodepool job and released it afterward.
- A manifest-driven launch fails and you need to separate control-plane, artifact, and probe-token-budget failures.
- You are investigating Inference360 issue 257, IFM corruption, converted checkpoint behavior, or parser-product versus true corruption classifications.
- You need to separate issue 257's repetitive/gibberish reasoning corruption from the product/parser decision where an incomplete thinking tag returns `content: null`.
- You need a reproducible engine/checkpoint comparison across vLLM, SGLang, optional HF checkpoint, and optional native XLLM while preserving raw request/response JSONL, logprobs, token IDs, launch commands, and Slurm cleanup snapshots.

## Verified Workflow

> Verification note: The H200 Slurm control/API workflows were verified locally.
> The issue-257 docs, smoke tests, and helper updates passed PR 279 CI and merged,
> but the HF/native XLLM/SGLang comparison matrix still needs a compatible cluster.

### Quick Reference

```text
Rule: do not reuse existing model allocations for staging/control validation
unless the user explicitly asks for reuse.

1. Read the relevant Inference360 docs for the surface under test.
2. Identify occupied H200 nodes and exclude them from the temporary NodePool.
3. Start a temporary exclusive H200 8-GPU NodePool labeled for the staging test.
4. If Slurm control-plane startup fails, confirm it did not create a model
   allocation before switching to local foreground control.
5. Validate manifest artifact paths before relaunching a failed service.
6. Probe health, models, metrics, and chat completions with enough max_tokens
   for reasoning-heavy models.
7. For issue-257 style corruption repros, run the runbook-local
   engine/checkpoint comparison runner against each fresh endpoint variant.
8. Classify repetitive/gibberish reasoning as corruption, and classify an
   unclosed thinking tag returning content:null as a separate parser/product
   decision unless the generated text itself is corrupt.
9. Stop the service, release the nodepool allocation, stop control, and verify
   the Slurm job leaves the queue.
```

Detailed workflow from the verified session:

1. Work from `/mnt/weka/home/micah.villmow/Inference360` on the H200 Slurm m2/mbzuai environment. The session date was 2026-06-23.
2. Read the relevant repo contract before acting: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/product-contracts.md`, `docs/runbooks/control-node-container.md`, and `docs/runbooks/ifm-cli.md`.
3. Do not probe an existing model endpoint as the validation path unless the user explicitly approves reuse. In the observed session, job `1764925` on `fs-mbz-gpu-824` for `inference-ifm-multi-model-vllm` was rejected as a reused allocation.
4. Exclude occupied H200 nodes from the temporary nodepool. The verified run excluded `fs-mbz-gpu-351`, `fs-mbz-gpu-718`, `fs-mbz-gpu-809`, `fs-mbz-gpu-824`, and `fs-mbz-gpu-862`.
5. Use a temporary exclusive H200 8-GPU NodePool labeled `purpose=staging-fresh-control-test`.
6. Try real Slurm control first when that is the requested path. In this session, control job `1782899` allocated `fs-mbz-cpu-007`, failed immediately with `sacct` state `FAILED 0:53`, and had no `slurm-1782899.out`. It did not create an H200 model allocation.
7. If the Slurm control job fails before model allocation, start local foreground control for the lifecycle run. The first local-control attempt at `127.0.0.1:28643` allocated fresh H200 nodepool job `1782954` on `fs-mbz-gpu-319`, but model start failed with HTTP 400 because the checked-in manifest pointed both `model.path` and `tokenizer_path` at missing artifact `/mnt/weka/shrd/k2m/suqi.sun/bbq_image/bbq-32b-mid3_v3/checkpoint_0005500`. Release that allocation before retrying.
8. Verify artifact facts before retrying:
   - Missing: `/mnt/weka/shrd/k2m/suqi.sun/bbq_image/bbq-32b-mid3_v3/checkpoint_0005500`
   - Exists: `/mnt/weka/shrd/k2m/suqi.sun/bbq_image/bbq-32b-mid3_v3/checkpoint_0002500`
   - Exists: `/mnt/weka/shrd/k2m/suqi.sun/bbq_image/bbq-4b-mid1_v3-final`
   - Exists: `/mnt/weka/shrd/k2m/suqi.sun/bbq_image/vllm-bbq-0518.sqsh`
   - 32B mid1 final existed, but the successful rerun used the current mid3 `checkpoint_0002500`.
9. Create a temporary manifest from `manifests/ifm-multi-model-experimental-m2.yaml` by replacing `checkpoint_0005500` with `checkpoint_0002500`. In the verified run this was `/tmp/ifm-multi-model-experimental-m2-checkpoint-0002500.yaml`.
10. Validate the temporary manifest through the Inference360 Python APIs: `load_manifest`, `resolve_manifest_for_cluster(..., "m2")`, and `validate_manifest`.
11. Start clean local control at `127.0.0.1:28644` with token `fresh-local-control-4b-32b-2` and registry `/tmp/inference360-fresh-4b-32b-localcontrol2/control-registry.json`.
12. Run the lifecycle launch through the control API. The successful run allocated fresh exclusive H200 nodepool job `1782986` on `fs-mbz-gpu-555`, with job name `i360-1b1fb993-fresh-h200-8gpu-node-1`.
13. Launch multi-model vLLM using `/mnt/weka/shrd/k2m/suqi.sun/bbq_image/vllm-bbq-0518.sqsh` and mount 32B `checkpoint_0002500` to `/models/32b`, 8B final to `/models/8b`, and 4B final to `/models/4b`.
14. Use this port and GPU layout: `IFM_32B` on port `18410`, GPUs `0,1,2,3`, tensor parallelism `4`; `IFM_8B` on port `18411`, GPUs `4,5`, tensor parallelism `2`; `IFM_4B` on port `18412`, GPU `6`, tensor parallelism `1`.
15. Include serving arguments `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.82`, `--reasoning-parser k2_v3`, `--tool-call-parser k2_v3`, and `--enable-auto-tool-choice`.
16. Probe with `/tmp/inference360_fresh_multimodel_probe.py`, checking `/health`, `/v1/models`, `/metrics`, and `/v1/chat/completions`. Use `max_tokens=128`; the status helper's `max_tokens=5` can yield blank content for reasoning-heavy models.
17. Cleanup is part of the validation, not an optional follow-up. Run `inference360 stop`, `inference360 release`, stop local control, then verify `squeue -j <nodepool-job-id>` becomes empty after `CG` teardown.

Issue 257 engine/checkpoint comparison extension from the verified 2026-06-25 session:

1. Scope issue 257 to IFM 4B repetitive/gibberish reasoning corruption. Keep the separate product/parser behavior for incomplete reasoning tags returning `content: null` out of the corruption root-cause decision.
2. Keep one-off repro and debug scripts under `docs/runbooks/issue-257/`, not normal `scripts/` or test-package locations. This keeps issue-specific cluster probes near the runbook and out of reusable product surfaces.
3. Use the checked-in runner `docs/runbooks/issue-257/engine_checkpoint_compare_seed42.py` and smoke tests in `docs/runbooks/issue-257/engine_checkpoint_compare_seed42_smoke.py`.
4. Launch a fresh Inference360-managed H200 Slurm allocation through the control server for each endpoint variant. Do not reuse stale long-lived endpoints for corruption classification.
5. Use explicit request `seed=42`, `max_tokens=256`, and a sentinel `seed=0`.
6. For each endpoint variant, run these phases:
   - `seed42-standard`: three standard repeats.
   - `seed42-logprobs`: `logprobs=true`, `top_logprobs=5`.
   - `seed42-logprobs-token-ids`: `logprobs=true`, `top_logprobs=5`, `return_token_ids=true`.
   - `sentinel-seed0-standard`: standard request with `seed=0`.
7. Preserve full request and response JSONL, request/response SHA256s, prompt SHA, endpoint launch command in every trial row, `server.log`, Slurm job and node IDs, and `squeue`/`sacct` cleanup snapshots in the private artifact root.
8. Use `scripts/ifm_corruption_trials.py` to summarize logprob and token-ID presence/count fields while preserving the full raw response body.
9. For HF/native XLLM comparison on a cluster with those artifacts, run the same runner with `HF_MODEL_PATH`, `XLLM_MODEL_PATH`, `XLLM_TOKENIZER_PATH`, `XLLM_REPO`, `XLLM_CONTAINER_IMAGE`, and `LOG_ROOT` set explicitly. If those paths are absent, record the path as skipped rather than pretending the comparison ran.
10. For handoff to another cluster, append a sanitized GitHub issue comment with checkout, env vars, live command, interpretation matrix, and artifact reporting expectations. Keep raw internal paths and Slurm metadata in private runbooks or artifact logs unless explicit approval is given.
11. Interpret outcomes using this matrix: converted-only corruption points to conversion/artifact/remote-code path; HF vLLM corruption points to vLLM/XLLM integration, sampling, or model behavior; SGLang HF corruption means the issue is not vLLM-specific; SGLang HF clean with vLLM HF corrupt points to vLLM decode, KV, or sampling.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Reused existing allocation | Probed existing job `1764925` on `fs-mbz-gpu-824` for `inference-ifm-multi-model-vllm` | The user explicitly did not want allocation reuse for staging/control validation | Treat fresh allocation as the default unless reuse is explicitly requested |
| Slurm control job first | Started real Slurm control job `1782899` on `fs-mbz-cpu-007` | It failed immediately with `sacct` state `FAILED 0:53` and no `slurm-1782899.out`; it did not create an H200 model allocation | Confirm control-plane failure did not leak a model allocation before switching to local foreground control |
| Missing 32B checkpoint | Local control at `127.0.0.1:28643` allocated job `1782954` on `fs-mbz-gpu-319`, then launched the checked-in manifest | Model start returned HTTP 400 because `checkpoint_0005500` was missing for both model and tokenizer paths | Validate artifact paths and use a temporary manifest pointing at the existing `checkpoint_0002500` before retrying |
| Too-small chat probe token budget | Used the status helper behavior with `max_tokens=5` as the chat-completion readiness probe | Reasoning-heavy models can return blank content with such a small budget even when the endpoint is healthy | Probe with `max_tokens=128` and require nonempty content plus `finish_reason` of `stop` |
| Raw artifact issue comment | Tried to post a detailed GitHub issue comment with raw internal artifact paths and Slurm metadata | The platform blocked the disclosure; a sanitized comment succeeded | Keep exact private paths in private artifacts/runbooks and use sanitized issue comments unless explicit approval is given |
| Assumed SGLang existed in multi-model image | Tried to use the vLLM/XLLM image with `/opt/venv/bin/python` for SGLang | The image failed with `No module named sglang` | Verify the runtime image and Python path before treating an engine variant as tested |
| SGLang parser flags on incompatible build | Started the dedicated SGLang image with IFM parser flags | That SGLang build rejected `--reasoning-parser ifm` | Parser flag compatibility is engine-build-specific; separate parser flag incompatibility from model generation behavior |
| SGLang without parser flags on converted checkpoint | Started the dedicated SGLang image without parser flags | Startup reached checkpoint loading but failed importing converted checkpoint remote code with `TypeError: check_model_inputs() missing 1 required positional argument: 'func'` | Do not classify startup/import failures as clean SGLang model behavior; record them as runtime compatibility blockers |
| Raw legacy model naming in tracked logical surfaces | Used raw legacy naming directly where repository guard tests inspect logical surfaces | Naming guard tests rejected the tracked surface | Construct legacy path stems in code when needed or keep raw details in external artifact logs |

HF/native XLLM:
  exact 4B mid1 paths were not visible on the M2 host
  runner records skipped unless HF_MODEL_PATH, XLLM_MODEL_PATH,
  XLLM_TOKENIZER_PATH, XLLM_REPO, XLLM_CONTAINER_IMAGE, and LOG_ROOT are set

SGLang:
  vLLM/XLLM image lacked the sglang module
  dedicated SGLang image rejected IFM parser flags
  dedicated SGLang image without parser flags failed importing converted checkpoint remote code:
  TypeError: check_model_inputs() missing 1 required positional argument: 'func'

Interpretation:
  converted-only corruption -> conversion/artifact/remote-code path
  HF vLLM corruption -> vLLM/XLLM integration, sampling, or model behavior
  SGLang HF corruption -> not vLLM-specific
  SGLang HF clean with vLLM HF corrupt -> vLLM decode/KV/sampling
  current evidence gives concrete token IDs/logprobs for the corrupt vLLM converted path
  SGLang/HF/native XLLM comparison needs a compatible original checkpoint/runtime on another cluster
