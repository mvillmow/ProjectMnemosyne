# CI Broken-Main Parallel Fix Wave

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-05-03 |
| **Objective** | Use the HomericIntelligence agent mesh to fix broken CI/main across multiple repositories simultaneously — NATS + Agamemnon task registry + parallel Claude Code sub-agents as myrmidon workers |
| **Outcome** | Successful — all 14 repos triaged, 6 root causes identified across 4 repos, 4 fix PRs opened with auto-merge, 2 issues filed without PRs (non-trivial scope / transient-confirmed network failures) |
| **Verification** | verified-ci — fix PRs opened and auto-merge armed; patterns verified by reproducing failures locally |
| **History** | [changelog](./ci-cd-broken-main-parallel-fix-wave.history) |

## When to Use

- 3 or more HomericIntelligence repos have broken CI on their main branch simultaneously
- Need to register fix tasks in Agamemnon before dispatching agents (audit trail + coordination)
- CI failures span diverse root causes requiring per-failure triage before dispatch
- Want to select agent tier (Haiku vs Sonnet) based on whether the root cause is already known
- Need to restore green main across the ecosystem before a cross-repo feature push
- Full 14-repo health sweep needed (e.g. before a large cross-repo release or audit)
- Release workflow directly pushes version bump to `main` (branch protection violation)
- Duplicate module re-export causing import conflicts in Python packages
- Pydantic models using manual `to_dict()` with field enumerations instead of `model_dump()`

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Step 0 (fast): List all 14 submodule repos from .gitmodules
grep 'url = ' .gitmodules | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's|.*/||'

# Step 1: Triage CI across all repos — use workflow run list (more reliable than commit status)
REPOS="ProjectAgamemnon ProjectNestor ProjectKeystone ProjectCharybdis ProjectArgus ProjectHermes ProjectHephaestus ProjectOdyssey ProjectScylla ProjectMnemosyne ProjectProteus ProjectTelemachy Myrmidons AchaeanFleet"
for repo in $REPOS; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  gh run list --repo HomericIntelligence/$repo --branch main --limit 2 \
    --json conclusion,headBranch,workflowName,createdAt \
    --jq '.[] | select(.headBranch=="main") | "\(.workflowName): \(.conclusion)"'
done

# Step 2: Drill into each failure
gh run view <run_id> --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo> --log-failed 2>&1 | \
  grep -E "::error|Error:|FAILED" | head -20

# Step 3: Confirm transient vs reproducible BEFORE filing anything
gh run rerun <run_id> --failed --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo>
gh run watch <new_run_id> --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo>
# If new run also fails → reproducible → file issue + open PR
# If new run passes → transient → no action

# Step 4: Register fix tasks in Agamemnon (use /v1/teams/<teamId>/tasks — NOT /v1/tasks)
TEAM_ID="<your-team-id>"
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/teams/$TEAM_ID/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"task_id":"fix-<repo>-<issue>","title":"<description>","status":"pending","priority":"high"}'

# Step 5: Dispatch parallel fix agents (select tier by root cause certainty)
# Known fix + 1-3 file changes → Haiku
# Unknown root cause + investigation required → Sonnet
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Phase 0: Enumerate All Repos

Parse `.gitmodules` for the canonical list — don't hardcode:

```bash
grep 'url = ' .gitmodules | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's|.*/||'
```

#### Phase 1: Triage — Identify Broken Repos

Use `gh run list` (more reliable than `commits/main/status` for fresh runs):

```bash
for repo in $REPOS; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  gh run list --repo HomericIntelligence/$repo --branch main --limit 2 \
    --json conclusion,headBranch,workflowName,createdAt \
    --jq '.[] | select(.headBranch=="main") | "\(.workflowName): \(.conclusion)"'
done
```

For each broken repo, drill into the failing log:

```bash
# Get the most recent failed run
gh run list --repo HomericIntelligence/$REPO --branch main --status failure --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId'
# Read the failure log
gh run view $RUN_ID --repo HomericIntelligence/$REPO --log-failed
```

Classify each failure into one of the known patterns (see Results & Parameters below).

#### Phase 1b: Transient vs Reproducible Triage

**CRITICAL**: Re-run every failing job before filing an issue or PR:

```bash
gh run rerun <run_id> --failed --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo>
gh run watch <new_run_id> --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo>
```

- New run also fails with same error → **reproducible** → file issue + open PR
- New run passes → **transient** → no issue, no PR (note in triage log)

**Example transient**: Agamemnon `schema-validation` failed HTTP 503 from json.schemastore.org. Two re-runs also failed → elevated to "persistent" → filed issue recommending schema vendoring (no PR needed — fix requires deliberate design).

#### Phase 2: Register Tasks in Agamemnon

Before dispatching agents, register each fix as a task in Agamemnon for coordination and audit trail:

```bash
TEAM_ID="<your-team-id>"
AGAMEMNON="http://localhost:8080"

# Register one task per repo/failure
curl -s -X POST $AGAMEMNON/v1/teams/$TEAM_ID/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "task_id": "fix-odysseus-conan-profile",
    "title": "Odysseus build.yml: add conan profile detect step",
    "status": "pending",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
```

**Critical**: Use `/v1/teams/<teamId>/tasks` — not `/v1/tasks` (returns 404).

#### Phase 3: Dispatch Fix Agents (Tier-Selected)

Select agent tier based on root cause certainty:

| Certainty Level | Agent Tier | Example Failures |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Known fix, 1-3 file mechanical change | Haiku | conan profile detect, dependabot.yml cleanup, persist-credentials, annotated-tag SHA fix, pixi.lock regen, markdownlint CHANGELOG |
| Unknown root cause, investigation required | Sonnet | BATS exit 127, Python import errors, pixi cache 400, schema validation network errors |

Dispatch agents in parallel. Each agent should:
1. Read the specific CI failure log
2. Apply the fix (see Known Fix Patterns in Results & Parameters)
3. Push to a feature branch + create PR
4. Update task status in Agamemnon to `in-progress` / `done`

#### Phase 4: Update Agamemnon Task Status

As agents complete their work, update task states:

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH $AGAMEMNON/v1/teams/$TEAM_ID/tasks/fix-odysseus-conan-profile \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status": "done"}'
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `/v1/tasks` Agamemnon endpoint | `POST /v1/tasks` to register fix tasks | Returns 404 — endpoint does not exist | Correct endpoint is `/v1/teams/<teamId>/tasks` (team-scoped) |
| `bats-core/bats-action@2` in GitHub Actions | Used `bats-core/bats-action@2` to install BATS | Action version `@2` does not exist on GitHub Marketplace | Use `apt-get install bats` or `bats-core/bats-action@1` |
| `peter-evans/create-pull-request` without `persist-credentials: false` | `actions/checkout` default + `peter-evans/create-pull-request@271a8d0` | "fatal: Duplicate header: Authorization" — both steps configure git credentials independently | Add `persist-credentials: false` to the `actions/checkout` step when using `peter-evans/create-pull-request` |
| Dispatching all agents as Haiku | Used Haiku for BATS exit 127 and Python type error investigation | Haiku lacks the reasoning depth to investigate unknown root causes from log output alone | Escalate to Sonnet for failures where root cause is not already known before dispatch |
| Running `conan` directly after `setup-pixi` | Assumed `setup-pixi` initialized conan profiles | Conan 2.x requires explicit `conan profile detect` — profiles don't auto-initialize | Always add `pixi run conan profile detect` as an explicit step after `setup-pixi`, before build scripts |
| Dependabot docker block with no Dockerfiles | Kept `package-ecosystem: docker` in dependabot.yml despite no Dockerfiles | Dependabot fails hard with "dependency_file_not_found /Dockerfile" — no graceful skip | Remove `package-ecosystem: docker` blocks unless the repo actually contains Dockerfiles |
| Running local clang-format on C++ PRs | Used system clang-format-14 on Debian 11 dev host to reformat before push | CI uses clang-format-18 on ubuntu-24.04; version differences produce divergent formatting decisions | Always use `podman run ubuntu:24.04` with the exact CI clang-format version — never the local system version |
| Monitor filter emitting only on success | Set monitor `filter="conclusion == 'success'"` for CI polling | If the run fails, filter never emits — silence is indistinguishable from "still running" | Monitor filter MUST include failure: `conclusion == 'failure' OR conclusion == 'success'` |
| 30s monitor poll for release builds | Used 30s poll interval for long-running C++ release CI | Generates 60+ noisy notifications during a 30-minute build; distracts from other work | Use 60s interval for release builds; 30s only for fast checks (lint, pre-commit) |
| `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<tag>` for SHA resolution | Used the `commits` endpoint to resolve an annotated tag to a commit SHA | Returns HTTP 422 — annotated tag object SHA is not a commit SHA; `commits/` endpoint rejects it | Use `git/ref/tags/<tag>` + check `.object.type`; if type=`tag`, dereference via `git/tags/<sha>` |
| `.markdownlintignore` alone for CHANGELOG exclusion | Added CHANGELOG.md to `.markdownlintignore` | Only works when markdownlint discovers files via glob, not when files are passed as explicit args | Must also add `!CHANGELOG.md` directly to workflow glob — see Pattern 8 for three-layer exclusion |
| `ignorePatterns` in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` alone for CHANGELOG | Added CHANGELOG.md to `ignorePatterns` | CI used markdownlint-cli2 v0.17.2 which did not honor `ignorePatterns`; local v0.22.1 did | Always add `!CHANGELOG.md` to workflow globs directly — most reliable across all CLI versions |
| `git rebase origin/main` on a branch with already-merged commits | Used direct rebase when branch contained commits already merged to main | Caused conflicts on the duplicate commits | Use `git rebase --onto origin/main <sha-before-first-unique-commit> <branch>` to replay only unique commits |
| Filing issues without first re-running CI | Filed issues immediately after observing a red CI run | Some failures were transient (network errors, timing); issue was unnecessary | Always re-run the failing job first; only file an issue if the new run also fails |
| Release workflow direct push to `main` | `release.yml` pushed version bump commit directly to `main` | Branch protection rules block direct pushes; workflow fails with 403 | Push version bump to `release/version-bump-${{ env.VERSION }}` branch and open a PR via `gh pr create` + `gh pr merge --auto --rebase`; add `pull-requests: write` permission to the workflow |
| Duplicate circuit-breaker re-export | Had `automation/circuit_breaker.py` as a full duplicate of `scylla.core.circuit_breaker` | Import conflicts when both paths are in scope; maintenance burden of two copies | Convert the duplicate to a DeprecationWarning shim that re-imports from the canonical location |
| Manual `to_dict()` with field enumerations | 14 Pydantic model methods manually enumerated every field in `to_dict()` | Broke when new fields added (silently omitted); no consistency guarantee | Replace manual field enumerations with `self.model_dump(mode='json')`; inject computed `@property` values post-dump; use `exclude=` for ephemeral runtime fields |
| Single-repo broken main not detected before rebasing downstream PRs | Rebased 6 in-flight PRs onto stale broken main; CI re-ran and failed identically | All downstream PRs inherit main's failure when CI matrix runs against the new HEAD. Rebase doesn't fix main. | Before rebasing any PR, check `gh run list --branch main --limit 5 --json conclusion`. If main's "Build and Test" or "Static Analysis" is `failure`, fix main FIRST via a dedicated `fix-ci-*` PR with auto-merge=SQUASH, wait for it to merge, THEN rebase downstream PRs. |
| Considered rebasing each ProjectMnemosyne PR individually when 5 unrelated PRs (#1751, #1752, #1753, #1754, #1724) all failed only on `markdownlint` | Initial instinct was per-PR rebase + CI rerun on 3 skill amendments + 1 new skill + 1 dependabot bump | All 5 failures pointed to the SAME file/line (`skills/ci-cd-gated-debug-instrumentation-workflow-dispatch.md:107`, MD056 table-pipe-escape) which none of the PRs touched. `git log --oneline -5 -- <file>` showed the file landed via PR #1741 (commit 342c0e1d) on main. Rebasing copies the broken file into the branch — failure persists. | When the SAME job fails on UNRELATED PRs with the SAME file/line, treat it as broken-main even if the failure is "just" lint, not build/test. Fix at root with ONE PR against main; downstream PRs clear automatically after rebase. |
| Considered adding markdownlint `markdownlint-disable MD056` comments to each PR's skill files | Hoping per-branch suppression would unblock auto-merge faster than waiting on a main fix | Masks the actual bug (unescaped pipes inside table cells) without fixing it; replicates the suppression across 5 branches; future skill additions inherit the broken table as a template; PR diffs become misleading (the suppression isn't related to what the PR actually changes). | Always fix the broken markdown at the source file on main. Per-PR suppression of a root-cause failure is technical debt across N branches. |

## Results & Parameters

### Known CI Failure Fix Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Conan 2.x Profile Not Initialized (Odysseus `build.yml`)

**Error**: `"The default build profile '/home/runner/.conan2/profiles/default' doesn't exist"`

**Fix**: Add `pixi run conan profile detect` after `setup-pixi`, before build script:

```yaml
- uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
  with:
    pixi-version: latest

# ADD THIS STEP:
- name: Initialize Conan profile
  run: pixi run conan profile detect

- name: Build
  run: pixi run build
```

**Root cause**: Conan 2.x requires explicit profile initialization once per fresh environment. `setup-pixi` installs the conan binary but does not run `conan profile detect`.

---

#### Pattern 2: Duplicate Authorization Header (ProjectMnemosyne `update-marketplace.yml`)

**Error**: `"fatal: Duplicate header: Authorization"` when `peter-evans/create-pull-request` tries to push

**Fix**: Add `persist-credentials: false` to `actions/checkout`:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    persist-credentials: false  # ADD THIS LINE
    fetch-depth: 0
```

**Root cause**: Both `actions/checkout` (by default) and `peter-evans/create-pull-request` configure git HTTP credentials. When both are active simultaneously, git sees duplicate Authorization headers on push. `persist-credentials: false` tells checkout not to configure credentials, letting the PR action manage them exclusively.

---

#### Pattern 3: Dependabot Docker Block with No Dockerfiles (ProjectArgus `dependabot.yml`)

**Error**: `"dependency_file_not_found /Dockerfile"`

**Fix**: Remove the `package-ecosystem: docker` block:

```yaml
# REMOVE this block if no Dockerfiles exist in the repo:
# - package-ecosystem: docker
#   directory: /
#   schedule:
#     interval: weekly
```

**Root cause**: Dependabot fails hard rather than gracefully skipping when configured to scan for Dockerfiles but none are present in the repository.

---

#### Pattern 4: BATS `run_validate` Exits 127 (Myrmidons `test_validate.bats`)

**Error**: Tests 197, 201, 203 fail with exit code 127 (command not found) for `run_validate`

**Investigation path** (Sonnet required):
1. Read `test_validate.bats` — check `load` directives at top of file
2. Verify the helper file defining `run_validate` exists at the referenced path
3. Check PATH inside the test environment (BATS `setup()` function)
4. Ensure the helper script is executable and `load` path is relative to `$BATS_TEST_DIRNAME`

**Root cause**: BATS helper function not in scope — likely bad `load` directive path or missing helper source.

---

#### Pattern 5: Python Type Errors + Import Failures (ProjectTelemachy)

**Error**: Python type errors, pixi cache 400, `telemachy.agamemnon_client` import resolution failure

**Investigation path** (Sonnet required):
1. Check for missing `__init__.py` files in the package directory
2. Verify `pyproject.toml` `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` includes the correct source directory
3. Clear pixi cache: `pixi clean` then `pixi install`
4. Check if the module path changed (e.g., `telemachy/agamemnon_client.py` vs `src/telemachy/agamemnon_client.py`)

**Root cause**: Likely package structure issue — missing `__init__.py`, wrong module path, or stale pixi cache key causing 400 on cache fetch.

---

#### Pattern 6: clang-format Version Mismatch (C++ PRs after CI run)

**Error**: CI reports `clang-format: would reformat <file>` after otherwise passing build/test/tidy steps.

**Root cause**: Developer ran `clang-format` locally using a different version (e.g., clang-format-14 on Debian
11) than CI (clang-format-18 on ubuntu-24.04). Version differences produce divergent formatting decisions.

**Fix**: Use `podman run` with the exact CI base image to reformat:

```bash
# Install exact CI clang-format version via ubuntu-24.04 container
podman run --rm -v $(pwd):/src ubuntu:24.04 bash -c "
  apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y clang-format-18 2>/dev/null
  cd /src
  clang-format-18 -i \$(git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD | grep -E '\.(cpp|cc|h|hpp)$')
"

# Commit the style fix and push to the existing branch
git add -u
git commit -m "style: apply clang-format to <feature-name>"
git push  # No new PR needed — existing PR picks up the new commit
```

**Agent tier**: Haiku — once pattern is identified from CI logs, the fix is mechanical.

---

#### Pattern 7: Annotated Tag SHA Pinning Failure (any workflow with `uses: owner/repo@<bad-sha>`)

**Error**: HTTP 422 from GitHub when resolving a `uses:` SHA that is a tag object SHA, not a commit SHA.

**Root cause**: Annotated tags require two-step resolution. The `git/ref/tags/<tag>` API returns the tag object SHA (type `"tag"`), not the commit SHA. Using the tag object SHA in `uses:` causes GitHub to reject it.

**Fix** (Haiku-tier — exact pattern):

```bash
# Step 1: Resolve tag
TAG_INFO=$(gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/ref/tags/<tag>" --jq '.object | {sha, type}')
SHA=$(echo "$TAG_INFO" | jq -r '.sha')
TYPE=$(echo "$TAG_INFO" | jq -r '.type')

# Step 2: If annotated (type=tag), dereference to commit SHA
if [ "$TYPE" = "tag" ]; then
  SHA=$(gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/tags/$SHA" --jq '.object.sha')
fi

echo "Pin to: uses: <owner>/<repo>@$SHA  # <tag>"
```

**Example**: `prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1` → type=tag (annotated) → dereference → `ba3bb36eb2066252b2363392b7739741bb777659`

**Failed approach**: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<tag>` — returns HTTP 422 for annotated tags.

---

#### Pattern 8: markdownlint CHANGELOG.md Exclusion

**Error**: markdownlint CI fails on CHANGELOG.md due to MD024 (duplicate headings: "Added", "Changed", "Fixed" repeat across version sections) and MD013 (long URLs).

**Root cause**: CHANGELOGs intentionally repeat section headings across version blocks. markdownlint does not know the difference between a CHANGELOG structure and a duplicate heading mistake.

**Fix** — Three-layer exclusion for reliability:

**`.markdownlintignore`** (works for glob-discovered files only):
```
CHANGELOG.md
```

**`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`** (works for some CLI versions):
```json
{
  "ignorePatterns": [
    "CHANGELOG.md",
    ".pixi/**"
  ]
}
```

**Workflow glob** (most reliable — always add this):
```yaml
- uses: DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@<sha>  # v<version>
  with:
    globs: |
      **/*.md
      !CHANGELOG.md
      !.pixi/**
      !.claude/**
```

**Key lesson**: Always add `!CHANGELOG.md` directly to the workflow glob. `.markdownlintignore` only works when markdownlint discovers files via glob; it does NOT apply when files are passed as explicit arguments. Local CLI v0.22.1 honors `ignorePatterns`; CI version v0.17.2 did not.

**Agent tier**: Haiku — three-layer exclusion pattern is mechanical once identified.

---

#### Pattern 9: Stale pixi.lock After pixi.toml Update

**Error**: `pixi install --locked` fails in CI with "lock-file not up-to-date with the workspace"

**Root cause**: `pixi.toml` was updated (new deps added, versions changed) but `pixi.lock` was never regenerated.

**Fix**:
```bash
cd <repo>
pixi install         # regenerates pixi.lock without --locked
git add pixi.lock
git commit -m "fix(ci): regenerate pixi.lock to sync with pixi.toml"
git push
```

**Note**: `pixi install` (no flags) always regenerates. Never use `--locked` in the local fix command — it hard-fails if out of sync.

**Agent tier**: Haiku — once the symptom is matched, the fix is one command.

---

### Transient vs Reproducible Decision Tree

```
CI run is red on main
   │
   ▼
gh run rerun <id> --failed --repo <org>/<repo>
   │
   ├─ New run PASSES → TRANSIENT → no action (note in triage log)
   │
   └─ New run FAILS with same error → REPRODUCIBLE
         │
         ├─ Fix is trivial (1-3 files, known pattern) → open PR
         └─ Fix requires design (network deps, schema vendoring) → file issue only
```

**Known persistent non-code failures**: External service HTTP 503 (json.schemastore.org, registry endpoints). These persist across re-runs but are infrastructure issues — file issues recommending vendoring or mirroring, do not attempt to "fix" the workflow.

---

### Ecosystem Health Check (All 14 Repos)

Full 14-repo triage pattern for a HomericIntelligence audit:

```bash
# Parse canonical repo list from .gitmodules
REPOS=$(grep 'url = ' .gitmodules | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's|.*/||')

# Check each repo — quick pass
for repo in $REPOS; do
  echo "=== $repo ==="
  gh run list --repo HomericIntelligence/$repo --branch main --limit 2 \
    --json conclusion,headBranch,workflowName,createdAt \
    --jq '.[] | select(.headBranch=="main") | "\(.workflowName): \(.conclusion)"'
done

# Drill into a failure
gh run view <run_id> --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo> --log-failed 2>&1 | \
  grep -E "::error|Error:|FAILED" | head -20
```

---

### git rebase --onto for Branches with Already-Merged Commits

When a PR branch contains commits already merged to main (from a predecessor PR), direct `git rebase origin/main` causes conflicts on the duplicate commits. Use `--onto`:

```bash
# Show which commits are unique (not on main)
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD

# Find the SHA of the last commit that is NOT unique (last shared commit)
git log --oneline <branch>  # find the SHA just before the first unique commit

# Replay only the unique commits onto main
git rebase --onto origin/main <sha-before-first-unique-commit> <branch-name>
```

**When to use**: Branch has N commits already merged to main + M additional unique commits. `--onto` replays only the M unique commits.

---

### GitHub Issue Filing Template

For each confirmed reproducible root cause:

```bash
gh issue create --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo> \
  --title "ci(main): <one-line summary>" \
  --label "bug,ci" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Symptom

Run <link>: \`<error message>\`

## Reproduction

\`\`\`bash
<exact local reproduction command>
\`\`\`

## Root cause

<1-3 sentences>

## Proposed fix

<description or link to PR>

## Affected workflows

- \`<workflow file>\` → \`<job name>\`
EOF
)"
```

**Labels**: Create `ci` label if missing:
```bash
gh label create ci --color 0075ca --repo HomericIntelligence/<repo>
```

---

---

#### Pattern 10: Release Workflow Direct Push to Main (ProjectScylla #1878)

**Error**: Release workflow fails with 403 -- branch protection blocks direct push to `main`

**Root cause**: The workflow commits a version bump directly to `main` rather than opening a PR.

**Fix**: Push version bump to a release branch and open a PR with auto-merge:

```yaml
# In release.yml -- replace direct push with PR flow
- name: Push version bump
  run: |
    git checkout -b release/version-bump-${{ env.VERSION }}
    git add pyproject.toml
    git commit -m "chore: bump version to ${{ env.VERSION }}"
    git push -u origin release/version-bump-${{ env.VERSION }}

- name: Open and auto-merge version bump PR
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    gh pr create \
      --title "chore: bump version to ${{ env.VERSION }}" \
      --body "Automated version bump from release workflow." \
      --base main \
      --head release/version-bump-${{ env.VERSION }}
    PR_NUM=$(gh pr list --head release/version-bump-${{ env.VERSION }} --json number --jq '.[0].number')
    gh pr merge "$PR_NUM" --auto --rebase
```

**Also required**: Add `pull-requests: write` to the workflow permissions block:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write  # ADD THIS
```

**Tag push** (`git push origin "${{ env.VERSION }}"`) is fine to keep as-is -- tags bypass branch protection.

**Agent tier**: Haiku -- exact pattern once the 403 error is identified.

---

#### Pattern 11: Duplicate Module Re-Export (Python -- DeprecationWarning Shim)

**Error**: Two modules export the same class from different paths, causing import conflicts or
maintenance burden when one is updated.

**Root cause**: `automation/circuit_breaker.py` was a full copy of `scylla.core.circuit_breaker`,
not a re-export. Updates to the canonical location were not reflected in the duplicate.

**Fix**: Convert the duplicate to a DeprecationWarning shim:

```python
# automation/circuit_breaker.py  -- shim, not a copy
import warnings
from scylla.core.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreaker, CircuitBreakerError  # noqa: F401

warnings.warn(
    "Import from 'automation.circuit_breaker' is deprecated. "
    "Use 'scylla.core.circuit_breaker' instead.",
    DeprecationWarning,
    stacklevel=2,
)
```

**Rules**:
- Keep the shim in place for at least one release cycle to avoid breaking callers
- Only re-export names that are part of the public API (use `__all__` if needed)
- The canonical location owns the implementation; the shim owns nothing

**Agent tier**: Haiku -- pattern is mechanical once the duplicate is identified.

#### Pattern 12: Pydantic model_dump() Replacing Manual to_dict()

**Error**: Manual `to_dict()` methods silently omit new fields when the model grows; consistency
breaks across the codebase.

**Root cause**: 14 Pydantic model methods manually enumerated every field:

```python
# Before (brittle):
def to_dict(self) -> dict:
    return {
        "id": self.id,
        "name": self.name,
        "status": self.status,
        # ... 11 more fields, easily forgotten when model grows
    }
```

**Fix**: Replace with `model_dump()`:

```python
# After (complete and consistent):
def to_dict(self) -> dict:
    base = self.model_dump(mode='json')

    # Inject computed @property values not in model fields:
    base["display_name"] = self.display_name

    return base
```

**Special cases**:
- Computed `@property` values not stored as model fields: inject post-dump
- Ephemeral runtime fields that should NOT be serialized: use `exclude={"_lock", "_connection"}`

```python
base = self.model_dump(mode='json', exclude={"_lock", "_connection"})
```

**Agent tier**: Haiku -- once the pattern is identified, the replacement is mechanical.
Use `grep -r "def to_dict" --include="*.py"` to find all instances.

### Single-Repo Application (Agamemnon 2026-05-17)

When a single repo's downstream PR queue all shows `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` with identical
CI failure tallies (e.g. `FAILURE:13, SUCCESS:6`), the most common root cause is NOT "PRs need
rebase" -- it is that `main` itself is silently red. Rebasing onto a broken main wastes a full
CI cycle.

**Pre-flight check (run BEFORE rebasing any downstream PR):**

```bash
gh run list --branch main --limit 5 --json conclusion,status,name,createdAt
# If any of: "Build and Test", "Static Analysis", "Code Coverage" show conclusion=failure
# -> main is broken; downstream PRs cannot pass until a fix-main PR is merged FIRST
```

**Recovery sequence (verified-ci on ProjectAgamemnon 2026-05-17):**

1. Create `fix-ci-<symptom>-<date>` branch from `origin/main` (e.g. `fix-ci-circuit-breaker-clang-tidy-2026-05-17`).
2. Apply minimal fix to the broken files (typical: add `[[nodiscard]]`, add missing
   `#include <cstdint>` / `<chrono>`, add a missing mock member field).
3. Also fix any TEST failures unique to main that are NOT present on the downstream PRs.
   Examples from the Agamemnon session: `RoutesTaskTest.PatchTaskWithInvalidStatus` missing
   `require_enum` validation; `RateLimitedRouteTest` using `RateLimiter{2, 1e9}` where the
   second arg is `burst_capacity = 1 billion tokens`, not window-ns -- the test's request
   budget was effectively infinite.
4. Open the PR and arm `gh pr merge <N> --auto --squash`.
5. After the fix-main PR merges, rebase all downstream PRs onto the new green main:

   ```bash
   for pr in 387 388 389 390 391 392; do
     gh pr checkout "$pr"
     git rebase origin/main
     git push --force-with-lease
     gh pr merge "$pr" --auto --squash  # force-push clears auto-merge -- MUST re-arm
   done
   ```

6. **Critical**: every force-push clears the auto-merge state, so `gh pr merge --auto --squash`
   must be re-armed for each rebased PR.

**Session result**: 1 fix-main PR (#393) merged; 14 downstream PRs unblocked.

### Triage Checklist: "Same Failure Across Unrelated PRs" (ProjectMnemosyne 2026-05-18)

Even when the failing job is lint (not build/test), the broken-main pattern still applies. Use
this fast triage when N>=2 unrelated PRs go red on the same job at the same time:

1. **Same job failing on multiple unrelated PRs?** (e.g. `markdownlint` red on a dependabot PR,
   a new-skill PR, AND three skill-amendment PRs).
2. **`gh run view --job <id> --log-failed` points to the same file and same line on every PR?**
   (e.g. `skills/ci-cd-gated-debug-instrumentation-workflow-dispatch.md:107 MD056`).
3. **Is that file present on `main` and untouched by each PR's diff?**

   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5 -- skills/<offending-file>.md   # shows when file landed on main
   gh pr diff <num> -- skills/<offending-file>.md       # empty → PR did not touch it
   ```

4. **If all three are YES → fix at root.** One PR against `main` (e.g.
   `fix/markdownlint-table-pipe-escape`) with auto-merge armed. Rebase the N downstream PRs once
   the fix-main PR merges.

**Session example (ProjectMnemosyne, 2026-05-18)**: 5 unrelated open PRs (#1751, #1752, #1753,
#1754, #1724) all failed only on `markdownlint`. All pointed to
`skills/ci-cd-gated-debug-instrumentation-workflow-dispatch.md:107` (MD056, unescaped pipe in
table cell). `git log --oneline -5 -- <file>` showed the file landed via PR #1741 (commit
342c0e1d); none of the 5 open PRs touched it. Fix: `fix/markdownlint-table-pipe-escape` (PR
#1755) escaped the offending pipes; downstream PRs cleared after rebase.

### Monitor Noise Reduction Pattern

When polling CI status for long-running release builds, 30-second poll intervals cause excessive
notifications. Recommended approach:

```bash
# Stop a noisy monitor
TaskStop <monitor-id>

# Re-arm with tighter filter (emit on FAILURE too, not just success)
# and longer poll interval for release builds
Monitor(
    filter="conclusion == 'failure' OR conclusion == 'success'",
    interval_seconds=60
)
```

**Rules:**
- Use 30s poll for fast checks (lint, pre-commit). Use 60s for release/build CI runs.
- Monitor filter MUST emit on FAILURE too — `conclusion == 'success'` only causes silent misses
  if the run fails. Silence does NOT mean "still running".
- If a monitor produces too much noise: `TaskStop` the old one, re-arm with longer interval.

### Agent Tier Selection Table

| Failure Type | Agent Tier | Why |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| conan profile detect missing | Haiku | Exact fix known: add 1-line step to workflow YAML |
| dependabot.yml docker block cleanup | Haiku | Exact fix known: remove block from YAML |
| persist-credentials: false missing | Haiku | Exact fix known: add 1 attribute to checkout step |
| clang-format violations | Haiku | Once CI version identified, fix is mechanical: podman reformat + `style:` commit |
| annotated-tag SHA pinning (HTTP 422) | Haiku | Exact two-step resolution pattern known |
| pixi.lock stale after pixi.toml update | Haiku | One command to regenerate: `pixi install` |
| markdownlint CHANGELOG exclusion | Haiku | Three-layer exclusion pattern is mechanical |
| BATS exit 127 (run_validate not found) | Sonnet | Root cause unknown — requires reading test file + load directives |
| Python type errors + import failures | Sonnet | Root cause unknown — requires package structure investigation |
| Pixi cache 400 errors | Sonnet | Environment-dependent, requires cache invalidation + diagnosis |
| External service HTTP 5xx (schema, registry) | Issue only | Infrastructure dependency -- not a code fix |
| Release workflow direct push to main (403) | Haiku | Exact PR flow known: release branch + gh pr create + auto-merge |
| Duplicate module re-export (DeprecationWarning shim) | Haiku | Shim pattern is mechanical once duplicate identified |
| Manual to_dict() with field enumerations | Haiku | Replace with model_dump(mode='json') -- exact pattern known |

### Session Scale Reference

| Scale | Haiku Agents | Sonnet Agents | Estimated Time |
| ------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1-2 repos, known fix patterns | 2 Haiku | 0 | ~10-15 min |
| 3-5 repos, mixed known/unknown | 2-3 Haiku | 2-3 Sonnet | ~30-60 min (+ CI wait) |
| 10+ repos, diverse failures | 5+ Haiku | 4+ Sonnet | ~2-4 hours (+ CI wait) |
| 5 repos (2026-04-24 session) | 3 Haiku | 2 Sonnet | ~45-90 min |
| 14 repos / 4 broken (2026-05-01 session) | 4 Haiku | 0 Sonnet | ~2 hours (+ CI wait) |

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| HomericIntelligence ecosystem | 5 repos with broken main: Odysseus, Myrmidons, ProjectMnemosyne, ProjectArgus, ProjectTelemachy — 2026-04-24 | 5 fix tasks registered in Agamemnon, 5 parallel agents dispatched (3 Haiku + 2 Sonnet); PRs in flight at capture time |
| HomericIntelligence ecosystem | All 14 repos triaged -- 2026-05-01 | 4 repos red, 6 root causes identified, 4 fix PRs opened with auto-merge, 2 issues filed (non-trivial: schema vendoring, transient-confirmed); verified-ci |
| HomericIntelligence/ProjectScylla | Issues #1878, #1868, #1869 -- 2026-05-03 | release.yml direct-push fix (PR flow + auto-merge); circuit-breaker DeprecationWarning shim; 14 model_dump() replacements; verified-ci |
| HomericIntelligence/ProjectAgamemnon | Single-repo downstream PR queue blocked by silently-red main -- 2026-05-17 | 6 open PRs (#387-#392) all BLOCKED with identical CI failures; root cause was broken main since PR #286 (clang-tidy `modernize-use-nodiscard` / `misc-include-cleaner` on `circuit_breaker.cpp/.hpp` + missing `MockGitHubClient::fail_list_on_label` + 2 unique-to-main test failures); fix-main PR #393 merged then 14 downstream PRs rebased and unblocked; verified-ci |
| HomericIntelligence/ProjectMnemosyne | 5 unrelated PRs all failed only on `markdownlint` -- 2026-05-18 | PRs #1751, #1752, #1753, #1754, #1724 (three skill amendments, one new skill, one dependabot bump) all red on the same job, pointing to the same file/line (`skills/ci-cd-gated-debug-instrumentation-workflow-dispatch.md:107`, MD056). File landed on main via PR #1741 (342c0e1d); untouched by any open PR. Fix-at-root PR `fix/markdownlint-table-pipe-escape` (#1755) escaped offending pipes; 5 downstream PRs clear after rebase. Validates the "identical-failure-across-unrelated-PRs → broken main" triage even when the failure is lint, not build/test. |
