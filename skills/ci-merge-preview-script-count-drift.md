# CI Merge-Preview Script Count Drift

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-07 |
| **Objective** | Diagnose and fix CI failures caused by `[project.scripts]` count drift between a feature branch and main's merge-preview SHA |
| **Outcome** | Successfully applied to 8 PRs in one session — all passed CI after the fix |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |

## When to Use

- CI fails with: `ERROR: Prose counts disagree with pyproject.toml [project.scripts]: README.md: prose says 'N console scripts' but pyproject.toml [project.scripts] has N+1 entries`
- Pre-commit fails with: `FAIL: 1 tier-doc violation(s): [missing-from-docs] hephaestus-<script> is in pyproject.toml [project.scripts] but has no row in COMPATIBILITY.md`
- The failure appears on the **merge-preview SHA** (e.g., `refs/pull/<N>/merge`), not the branch's own HEAD
- A branch was cut before parallel PRs merged new console scripts into main
- Updating documentation that includes a prose count of console scripts

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Find the current script count on main (what the merge-preview will see)
git fetch origin main
git show origin/main:pyproject.toml | grep -c "hephaestus-"

# 2. Find scripts missing from COMPATIBILITY.md
diff \
  <(git show origin/main:pyproject.toml | grep "hephaestus-" | sed 's/ = .*//' | sort) \
  <(grep "^| \`hephaestus-" COMPATIBILITY.md | sed "s/^| \`//;s/\` |.*//" | sort)

# 3. Update prose counts in README.md and docs/index.md
#    (replace the N in "N console scripts" with the count from step 1)

# 4. Add missing scripts to COMPATIBILITY.md Console-Script Stability Tiers table
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1 — Understand the merge-preview mechanism

GitHub CI runs tests against the **merge-preview commit** (`refs/pull/<N>/merge`) — the result
of merging the PR branch into current `main`. This means:

- `pyproject.toml [project.scripts]` in the merge-preview comes from **main** (no conflict), so the installed package has ALL console scripts from main.
- Prose counts in `README.md` / `docs/index.md` come from the **PR branch** (if the branch didn't update them).
- `COMPATIBILITY.md` comes from the **PR branch** (if the branch didn't update it).

When parallel PRs merge new scripts into main after a branch is cut, that branch's docs become stale **only on the merge-preview SHA**, not on the branch's own HEAD.

#### Step 2 — Find the authoritative count

```bash
# Count how many scripts main's pyproject.toml declares
git fetch origin main
MAIN_COUNT=$(git show origin/main:pyproject.toml | grep -c "hephaestus-")
echo "Main has $MAIN_COUNT console scripts"

# List all script names from main
git show origin/main:pyproject.toml | grep "hephaestus-" | sed 's/ = .*//'
```

#### Step 3 — Fix prose counts in README.md and docs/index.md

```bash
# Find the current prose reference
grep -n "console script" README.md docs/index.md 2>/dev/null

# Update the count to match main's pyproject.toml
# Example: change "45 console scripts" to "46 console scripts"
sed -i "s/45 console scripts/$MAIN_COUNT console scripts/" README.md docs/index.md
```

#### Step 4 — Fix COMPATIBILITY.md missing rows

```bash
# Identify which scripts are in pyproject.toml but missing from COMPATIBILITY.md
diff \
  <(git show origin/main:pyproject.toml | grep "hephaestus-" | sed 's/ = .*//' | sort) \
  <(grep "^| \`hephaestus-" COMPATIBILITY.md | sed "s/^| \`//;s/\` |.*//" | sort)

# For each missing script, add a row to the appropriate tier in COMPATIBILITY.md
# Format: | `hephaestus-<name>` | `hephaestus.<module>:<function>` | <tier> | <since-version> |
```

#### Step 5 — Verify locally before pushing

```bash
# Confirm the count now matches
COMPAT_COUNT=$(grep -c "^| \`hephaestus-" COMPATIBILITY.md)
echo "COMPATIBILITY.md rows: $COMPAT_COUNT, main scripts: $MAIN_COUNT"
[ "$COMPAT_COUNT" -eq "$MAIN_COUNT" ] && echo "MATCH" || echo "MISMATCH — fix COMPATIBILITY.md"

# Verify README count
grep "console script" README.md
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Attempt 1 | Checked branch HEAD's `pyproject.toml` to find the script count | Branch HEAD has N-2 scripts (pre-parallel-PR state); the merge-preview has N from main. Fixing to N-2 breaks the merge-preview | Always use `git show origin/main:pyproject.toml` to get the authoritative count, not the branch's local file |
| Attempt 2 | Ran pre-commit locally on branch HEAD and saw no failures | The check compares installed package scripts (branch) vs. docs (branch) — they agree locally. The discrepancy only appears when CI installs from the merge-preview's merged `pyproject.toml` | Local pre-commit green ≠ CI green when the failure is a merge-preview artifact |
| Attempt 3 | Updated README prose count but not `docs/index.md` | The `hephaestus-check-cli-tier-docs` hook scans BOTH files; partial fix still fails | Always grep for ALL prose count references: `grep -rn "console script" README.md docs/index.md` |
| Attempt 4 | Updated prose counts but forgot to add the missing script to COMPATIBILITY.md | Two separate checks run: (a) prose count vs. `[project.scripts]`, (b) `[project.scripts]` entries vs. COMPATIBILITY.md rows. Both must pass | Fix both the prose count and the COMPATIBILITY.md row in the same commit |

## Results & Parameters

**Root cause pattern:** Branch cut before PR N-1 and PR N-2 merged into main. Those PRs each added one new `hephaestus-*` console script. The branch's `pyproject.toml` has N-2 scripts; after merge-preview, `pyproject.toml` has N scripts from main. The branch's `README.md`, `docs/index.md`, and `COMPATIBILITY.md` still reference N-2.

**Affected files (always three):**

| File | What to Fix |
|------|------------|
| `README.md` | Prose count: `"N console scripts"` → `"(N+K) console scripts"` |
| `docs/index.md` | Same prose count reference |
| `COMPATIBILITY.md` | Add missing row(s) to Console-Script Stability Tiers table |

**Diagnostic commands:**

```bash
# Count scripts on main
git show origin/main:pyproject.toml | grep -c "hephaestus-"

# List script names (sorted for diff)
git show origin/main:pyproject.toml | grep "hephaestus-" | sed 's/ = .*//' | sort

# List scripts already in COMPATIBILITY.md (sorted for diff)
grep "^| \`hephaestus-" COMPATIBILITY.md | sed "s/^| \`//;s/\` |.*//" | sort

# Find prose count references
grep -n "console script" README.md docs/index.md
```

**Session results:** Applied fix to 8 PRs in one session (2026-06-07). All 8 passed CI after updating prose counts + COMPATIBILITY.md rows. The failure was caused by two parallel PRs (#1046 adding `hephaestus-check-cli-tier-docs` and #1067 adding `hephaestus-audit-prs`) merging into main after the affected branches were cut.

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ProjectHephaestus | 8 PRs in session 2026-06-07 | Merge-preview SHA showed N+2 scripts from main vs. N in branch docs; fixed by updating README.md, docs/index.md, COMPATIBILITY.md |
