# NATS Server Auth/Authz Hardening (HomericIntelligence Mesh)

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-19 |
| **Objective** | Plan or implement NATS server-side authentication + authorization hardening for the HomericIntelligence mesh |
| **Outcome** | v1.0.0–v1.1.0: A plan was written then REVISED after a reviewer NOGO: reuse the X.509 mutual-cert trust chain via `verify_and_map` (client) + `verify` (cluster/leafnode), plus subject-scoped `accounts{}` mapped to the ADR-005 `hi.*` schema. v1.2.0: EXECUTED and CI-verified (issue #176, PR #303). Token-based auth added on BOTH the client listener AND the leafnode listener via two separate `authorization {}` blocks. Key traps documented: auth only on the client listener leaves the leafnode listener open; brace-depth awk required to validate nested configs; NATS exits non-zero (not silently empty string) on unset env vars; port 7422 for leafnode remotes; CI validator must be a dedicated step not just a justfile recipe. |
| **Verification** | `verified` (v1.2.0 — Odysseus issue #176, PR #303, CI passed) |
| **History** | [changelog](./nats-server-auth-authz-hardening.history) |

## When to Use

- You need to add application-layer authentication/authorization to NATS in a mesh where TLS has *already* landed (ADR-008) and you must not double-implement transport security.
- You are deciding between token-based auth, X.509 certificate mapping (`verify_and_map`), or decentralized operator/NKey/JWT and need the trade-off rationale.
- You are adding `authorization {}` to `server.conf` and need to know that the client listener and the `leafnodes {}` listener are SEPARATE — auth on the client listener does NOT protect the leafnode listener.
- You are configuring `leaf.conf` remotes and need to know the correct port (7422, not 4222) and token syntax.
- You are writing a shell validator for NATS config files that contain nested blocks (e.g. `tls {}` inside `leafnodes {}`) and need a brace-depth awk extractor instead of a simple range match.
- You need to write a CI step that asserts NATS auth is fail-closed and need to know the correct assertion (expect `nats-server -t` to exit non-zero when a required env var is unset, do NOT grep output).
- You are adding a NATS auth CI step and need to know it must be a dedicated step in `ci.yml`, not just a justfile recipe (CI never invokes `just validate-configs` unless the workflow explicitly calls it).
- You are scoping NATS subjects per role (agent / consumer / bridge) against the ADR-005 `hi.*` subject schema.
- You are about to write an ADR for mesh auth and need to know the next sequential number and the append-only rule.
- You are auditing whether `verify` / `verify_and_map` / `authorization{}` / `accounts{}` already exist in `configs/nats/`.
- You are tempted to rely on Tailscale/Tailnet isolation as the security boundary and need the counter-argument.
- You are mapping client certs to NATS users with `verify_and_map` and need to know what it actually matches (SAN-email → SAN-DNS → full RFC-2253 DN — NEVER a bare CN).
- You are about to flip NATS to fail-closed auth and need to enumerate every client that connects plaintext today before it breaks them.
- You need to triage per-client remediation: which clients are mTLS-capable-but-unconfigured (env-var fix) vs which lack cert wiring entirely (code fix / follow-up issue).
- You are writing acceptance criteria for a NATS auth change and need functional behavior tests (not just token-presence greps).

## Verified Workflow

> **Warning:** This workflow has not been validated end-to-end. Treat as a hypothesis until CI confirms. Verification level: `unverified` — this is a PLANNING + REVIEW learning. The plan was written, NOGO'd by a reviewer, and revised (v1.1.0) — but still NOT executed: no NATS config applied, no `nats-server -t` parse check, no functional auth test run. The highest-risk assumptions (SAN-DNS cert→user mapping semantics, JetStream API subject scoping, `accounts{}` syntax, `accounts{}`-in-leaf.conf validity, the `step ca ... --san` invocation) are listed unverified in Results & Parameters.

### Proposed Workflow

1. **Verify the on-disk config FIRST — do not trust an issue's cited line numbers.** The triggering issue (#175) cited `server.conf:12-21` as having "no tls block". That was STALE: TLS already landed via ADR-008 (PRs #290/#292). Confirm with a fresh read of `configs/nats/server.conf` and `configs/nats/leaf.conf`.

2. **Confirm TLS is present on every listener** (already true after ADR-008): `tls{}` on client (4222), leafnode (7422), cluster (6222), and monitoring HTTP (`127.0.0.1:8222`).

3. **Audit the auth/authz gap.** Run the grep in Quick Reference. The gap is: no `verify` / `verify_and_map` anywhere, and no `authorization{}` / `accounts{}` (only a commented `monitoring_authorization`).

4. **Reuse the ADR-008 X.509 mutual-cert PKI for identity — do NOT build decentralized JWT.** Add `verify_and_map` to the client `tls{}` (maps the client cert identity to a NATS user), and `verify` to the cluster and leafnode `tls{}` blocks (mutual cert required, no user mapping needed there). This avoids the operator keypair, JWT resolver, and out-of-band issuance pipeline that decentralized auth would require and that do not exist on disk.

5. **Map by SAN-DNS, NOT bare CN — this was the #1 reviewer NOGO.** `verify_and_map` matches the client cert identity in this order: **SAN email → SAN DNS → full RFC-2253 Subject DN**. It does NOT match a bare CN. A v1.0.0-style `accounts.users[].user = "hermes.homeric" # CN=...` would have matched NOTHING and rejected every client. FIX: define a cert convention where each role cert carries a **DNS SAN equal to `<role>.homeric`** AND set the `accounts.users[].user` value to that exact SAN-DNS string. SAN-DNS is deterministic (no DN field-ordering fragility); document the full RFC-2253 DN only as a discouraged fallback. Pin this convention in the ADR so cert issuance (`step ca certificate <role>.homeric cert.pem key.pem --san <role>.homeric`) and the config stay in lockstep.

6. **Define subject-scoped `accounts{}` mirroring ADR-005.** Map cert identities (by SAN-DNS, per step 5) to accounts with publish/subscribe permissions scoped to the `hi.*` schema (see Quick Reference). Agents, the Keystone consumer, and the Hermes bridge each get distinct scopes. JetStream consumers need `$JS.API.CONSUMER.>` AND `$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.>` AND `$JS.ACK.>` — under-scoping silently breaks consumer/ack ops; over-scoping is benign. Validate the set with the functional consumer test (step 11), not by asserting a "minimal" set blindly.

7. **Before flipping to fail-closed, enumerate EVERY plaintext client from real service code — not just `e2e/`.** On-disk facts in Odysseus submodules: `infrastructure/ProjectHermes/src/hermes/config.py:34` defaults `nats_url="nats://localhost:4222"`; `provisioning/ProjectTelemachy/src/telemachy/config.py:21` same; `docker-compose.crosshost.yml:45` sets `NATS_URL: nats://nats:4222`. Grepping only `e2e/ tools/ justfile` MISSES the real service clients. Grep every submodule's client config module for `nats://` / `NATS_URL` first.

8. **Triage each client: mTLS-capable-but-unconfigured vs needs-new-code.** ProjectHermes ALREADY supports mTLS (`config.py:102-105` has `tls_ca_bundle/tls_cert_file/tls_key_file/tls_verify`; `config.py:126 build_ssl_context()` loads a client cert chain when cert+key set or URL is `tls://`) → it needs CONFIG (env vars), not code. ProjectTelemachy has a `require_tls` gate (`agamemnon_client.py:46-58`) that rejects plain `nats://` when `REQUIRE_TLS=true` but has NO client-cert wiring → a genuine code gap to track as a FOLLOW-UP issue, not silently assume works. Remediation differs per client (runbook env vs code issue).

9. **Treat the stream-creator cert as a hard runbook prerequisite.** ProjectHermes creates JetStream streams on startup (ADR-005), so the HERMES account needs `$JS.API.>` publish AND its cert must be provisioned BEFORE enabling `verify_and_map` — otherwise NO streams get created mesh-wide (highest blast radius).

10. **Write a NEW ADR — never edit ADR-008.** ADRs are append-only (CLAUDE.md principle 3; `docs/adr/README.md`). The next sequential number was 009. Reference ADR-008 (TLS) and ADR-005 (subject schema); do not modify them. The SAN-DNS cert convention (step 5) MUST live in this ADR.

11. **Record AID v0.2.0 Ed25519 + scoped JWT as the documented FUTURE path,** not the now path. It needs an operator keypair, a JWT resolver, and an issuance pipeline that do not yet exist.

12. **Validate with FUNCTIONAL tests, not token greps — these are the real acceptance criteria** (NOT run this session — they are the gate). `grep "verify=true"` proves the token is present, not that auth is enforced. Against a running hardened server: (a) a no-cert connect MUST be refused; (b) the stream-creator cert MUST be able to create a stream; (c) a low-priv cert MUST get a "permissions violation" on a denied subtree (e.g. agent denied `hi.research.>`). Plus the `nats-server -t -c <conf>` parse check (or docker `nats:latest` fallback).

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Verify on-disk config (NEVER trust an issue's cited line numbers)
sed -n '1,40p' configs/nats/server.conf      # confirm tls{} on every listener
sed -n '1,40p' configs/nats/leaf.conf

# 2. Audit the auth/authz gap
grep -riE "verify|authorization|accounts|nkey|jwt|resolver|operator" configs/nats
# Expected today: only a commented monitoring_authorization — no verify/accounts

# 3. Find the next ADR number (append-only; never edit ADR-008)
ls docs/adr/ | grep -E '^[0-9]{3}-'    # next sequential number (was 009)

# 4. VALIDATION GATE — run these BEFORE claiming done (NOT run in planning)
nats-server -t -c configs/nats/server.conf    # parse check
nats-server -t -c configs/nats/leaf.conf
# fallback if nats-server not installed:
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/configs/nats:/c" nats:latest -t -c /c/server.conf

# 5. Post-edit grep assertions (NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT — presence != enforcement)
grep -q "verify_and_map" configs/nats/server.conf
grep -q "verify"         configs/nats/server.conf   # cluster + leafnode
grep -q "accounts {"     configs/nats/server.conf
grep -q "system_account" configs/nats/server.conf

# 6. Enumerate EVERY plaintext client before fail-closed (real service code, not just e2e/)
grep -rnE "nats://|NATS_URL" infrastructure provisioning control shared --include=*.py --include=*.yml --include=*.yaml
# Known on-disk: Hermes config.py:34, Telemachy config.py:21, docker-compose.crosshost.yml:45

# 7. Per-role cert with a DNS SAN equal to <role>.homeric (SAN-DNS is what verify_and_map maps)
step ca certificate hermes.homeric hermes.cert.pem hermes.key.pem --san hermes.homeric

# 8. FUNCTIONAL acceptance tests against a running hardened server (the REAL gate)
nats --server tls://hub:4222 pub hi.ping x                      # no cert -> MUST be refused
nats --server tls://hub:4222 --tlscert=hermes.cert.pem --tlskey=hermes.key.pem \
     stream add HI ...                                          # stream-creator -> MUST succeed
nats --server tls://hub:4222 --tlscert=agent.cert.pem --tlskey=agent.key.pem \
     sub 'hi.research.>'                                        # low-priv -> MUST get "permissions violation"
```

```hcl
# UNVERIFIED example shape — written from memory, NOT parse-checked.
# Client listener: map the client cert identity to a NATS user.
tls {
  # ... existing ADR-008 cert/key/ca ...
  verify_and_map = true        # client cert identity -> user field in accounts{}
}

# Cluster (6222) and leafnode (7422): mutual cert only, no user mapping.
cluster   { tls { verify = true } }
leafnodes { tls { verify = true } }

# Subject scoping mirrors ADR-005 hi.* schema.
# CRITICAL (v1.1.0): verify_and_map matches SAN-email -> SAN-DNS -> full RFC-2253 DN,
# NEVER a bare CN. Each role cert MUST carry a DNS SAN = "<role>.homeric" and the
# user= value MUST be that exact SAN-DNS string. (UNVERIFIED syntax — not parse-checked.)
accounts {
  AGENTS {
    users = [ { user = "agent.homeric" } ]   # matches cert DNS SAN "agent.homeric"
    exports = []
    # publish hi.agents.> + hi.tasks.>; explicitly deny subscribe hi.research.>
    permissions { publish { allow = ["hi.agents.>", "hi.tasks.>"] }
                  subscribe { deny = ["hi.research.>"] } }
  }
  KEYSTONE {
    users = [ { user = "keystone.homeric" } ]   # cert DNS SAN "keystone.homeric"
    # consumer: subscribe hi.tasks.> + JetStream consumer/info/ack subjects
    permissions { subscribe { allow = ["hi.tasks.>", "$JS.API.CONSUMER.>",
                                       "$JS.API.STREAM.INFO.>", "$JS.ACK.>"] } }
  }
  HERMES {
    users = [ { user = "hermes.homeric" } ]   # cert DNS SAN "hermes.homeric"
    # stream-creator (highest blast radius): cert MUST exist before verify_and_map
    permissions { publish   { allow = ["hi.>", "$JS.API.>"] }
                  subscribe { allow = ["hi.>", "$JS.API.>"] } }
  }
}
```

## Verified Workflow (v1.2.0) — Token Auth on Both Listeners

> **Verification:** `verified` — Odysseus issue #176, PR #303, CI passed (2026-06-19).

### Token Auth: The Dual-Listener Trap

NATS `server.conf` has two completely independent listeners: the **client listener** (port 4222) and the **leafnode listener** (port 7422). An `authorization {}` block at the top level of `server.conf` protects the CLIENT listener only. To protect the leafnode listener, a SEPARATE `authorization {}` block must live INSIDE the `leafnodes {}` block.

```hcl
# server.conf — TWO separate authorization blocks are required
authorization {
  token = "$NATS_CLIENT_TOKEN"   # protects the client listener (port 4222)
}

leafnodes {
  port = 7422
  tls {
    cert_file = "..."
    key_file  = "..."
    ca_file   = "..."
    verify    = true
  }
  authorization {
    token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"   # protects the leafnode listener — SEPARATE from above
  }
}
```

```hcl
# leaf.conf — remotes must use port 7422 (NOT 4222) and include the token
leafnodes {
  remotes = [{
    url = "nats+tls://<hub-ip>:7422"   # port 7422, NOT 4222 (4222 silently never connects)
    tls { ca_file = "/etc/nats/certs/ca.pem" }
    token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"          # env-substituted at parse time
  }]
}
```

### Token-Based Auth Workflow (issue #176)

1. **Add `authorization { token = "$NATS_CLIENT_TOKEN" }` at the top level of `server.conf`** (before any listener-specific blocks). This protects the 4222 client listener.

2. **Add a SECOND `authorization { token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN" }` block INSIDE the `leafnodes {}` block in `server.conf`.** This is a completely separate config directive. Without it the leafnode listener accepts anonymous connections.

3. **Add `token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"` to the `remotes` entry in `leaf.conf`**. NATS substitutes `$VAR` at parse time. If the env var is unset, `nats-server -t` exits non-zero (fail-closed) — it does NOT silently substitute empty string.

4. **Verify the leafnode remote URL targets port 7422, not 4222.** The `url` in the `remotes` block must be `nats+tls://<hub-ip>:7422`. A connection to 4222 from a leaf silently never establishes — there is no error at the leaf side, the leafnode just never joins.

5. **Write a validator using brace-depth awk.** A simple `awk '/leafnodes/,/}/'` range terminates at the FIRST `}` which is inside the nested `tls {}` block, not the closing `}` of `leafnodes {}`. The `authorization {}` that follows the `tls {}` block is never captured, giving a false negative on a correctly-configured file. The correct approach is brace-depth tracking:

```bash
# Brace-depth block extractor — correctly handles nested blocks
block() {
  local file="$1" kw="$2"
  sed 's/#.*//' "$file" | awk -v kw="$kw" '
    inb==0 && $0 ~ kw"[[:space:]]*\\{" { inb=1; d=0 }
    inb==1 {
      print
      o=gsub(/\{/,"{"); c=gsub(/\}/,"}"); d+=o-c
      if (d<=0) inb=2
    }'
}

# Usage: check that leafnodes{} contains an authorization block
block configs/nats/server.conf leafnodes | grep -q "authorization" || { echo "FAIL: leafnodes has no auth"; exit 1; }
```

6. **Wire the validator into CI as a DEDICATED STEP in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, NOT just a justfile recipe.** CI workflows only invoke `just` targets that are explicitly listed in a step. A recipe in the justfile is never invoked unless the workflow explicitly calls it. A `validate-configs` recipe in the justfile and a CI workflow that doesn't call it provide zero CI enforcement.

7. **Assert fail-closed with `! nats-server -c leaf.conf -t`, not grep on output.** When `$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN` is unset, NATS errors at parse time: `variable reference for "NATS_LEAF_TOKEN" can not be found` (non-zero exit). The correct CI assertion is `! nats-server -c configs/nats/leaf.conf -t 2>/dev/null` (expect non-zero). A grep-based assertion (`nats-server -c leaf.conf -t 2>&1 || true | grep -q 'NATS_LEAF_TOKEN'`) fails for the WRONG reason: NATS's error message contains the variable name, so grep matches and exits 1 even though the assertion was intended to prove fail-closed behavior.

### Quick Reference (v1.2.0)

```bash
# 1. Audit — check BOTH listeners for authorization
grep -n "authorization" configs/nats/server.conf   # must appear twice: once top-level, once inside leafnodes{}

# 2. Verify leafnodes authorization is inside the block (brace-depth, not range match)
block() {
  sed 's/#.*//' "$1" | awk -v kw="$2" '
    inb==0 && $0 ~ kw"[[:space:]]*\\{" { inb=1; d=0 }
    inb==1 { print; o=gsub(/\{/,"{"); c=gsub(/\}/,"}"); d+=o-c; if (d<=0) inb=2 }'
}
block configs/nats/server.conf leafnodes | grep -q "authorization"

# 3. Assert NATS is fail-closed on unset token (expect non-zero)
! nats-server -c configs/nats/leaf.conf -t 2>/dev/null

# 4. Check leaf.conf remote port (must be 7422)
grep "url" configs/nats/leaf.conf   # must contain :7422, NOT :4222

# 5. Check .gitignore covers credential files
grep -E "\*.creds|\*.pem|\*.key" .gitignore

# 6. Validate that the CI step is actually in the workflow (not just the justfile)
grep -n "validate\|nats" .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trust issue line-number evidence | #175 cited server.conf:12-21 as having no tls block | TLS already landed in ADR-008; cited lines were stale | Read the actual on-disk config; never plan against an issue's cited line numbers |
| Treat Tailscale as the security boundary | Rely on Tailnet isolation for mesh auth | Host-level isolation ≠ app-layer auth; one compromised host exposes the full mesh | Enforce app-layer auth on EVERY listener (client+cluster+leafnode), not just network isolation |
| Decentralized operator/NKey/JWT | Considered full NATS JWT auth (operator+resolver+accounts) | Needs operator keypair, JWT resolver, out-of-band issuance pipeline — none exist on disk | Reuse the existing ADR-008 X.509 mutual-cert PKI via verify_and_map; defer JWT to AID v0.2.0 |
| Map verify_and_map to bare CN | Set accounts user="hermes.homeric" expecting CN match | NATS matches SAN-email→SAN-DNS→full-DN, never bare CN; every client would be rejected | Carry a DNS SAN per role and set user= the SAN-DNS string; document the cert convention in the ADR |
| Grep only e2e/tools/justfile for nats:// | Scoped downstream-breakage check to e2e dirs | Missed real service clients (Hermes config.py:34, Telemachy config.py:21, compose:45) that default to plaintext nats:// and fail-close | Grep every submodule's client config module for nats:// / NATS_URL before enforcing auth |
| Assume all clients need new mTLS code | Treated client remediation uniformly | Hermes already had build_ssl_context()+cert fields (config not code); Telemachy genuinely lacked cert wiring (code) | Per client, distinguish capable-but-unconfigured from needs-code; remediation differs |
| Verify hardening with token greps only (v1.1.0) | grep verify=true / accounts{ to "prove" auth | Proves syntax/presence, not that unauth connect is rejected or scoping enforced | Add functional tests: no-cert rejected, stream-creator can create stream, low-priv denied a subtree |
| grep-based fail-closed CI assertion (v1.2.0) | `nats-server -c leaf.conf -t 2>&1 \|\| true \| grep -q 'NATS_LEAF_TOKEN'` | NATS errors at parse time; its error message contains the var name, so grep matches and incorrectly exits 1 even when config is valid | Use `! nats-server -c leaf.conf -t 2>/dev/null` — assert non-zero exit, don't grep output |
| Simple awk range extraction (v1.2.0) | `awk '/leafnodes/,/}/'` to extract leafnodes block | First `}` inside nested `tls {}` terminates the range; `authorization {}` after tls{} is never captured → false negative | Use brace-depth awk: count `{`/`}` depth; only stop when depth returns to 0 |
| Assuming .gitignore covers *.creds (v1.2.0) | `grep "creds" .gitignore` expected a match | `*.creds` was not in .gitignore even though `*.pem` was — a silent gap | Always verify gitignore coverage for credential file extensions explicitly; don't assume |
| Assuming justfile recipe = CI gate (v1.2.0) | Added `validate-nats-auth` recipe to justfile, assumed CI would run it | CI only invokes `just` targets that appear in explicit workflow steps; `ci.yml` never called `just validate-configs` | Wire validators as DEDICATED steps in `ci.yml`; a justfile recipe with no CI caller provides zero enforcement |

# Most uncertain assumptions (UNVERIFIED RISKS — highest first)
unverified_assumptions:
  - id: san-dns-mapping
    risk: highest
    claim: "verify_and_map matches SAN-DNS and the accounts.users[].user value must equal the cert's DNS SAN string"
    unknown: "the SAN-DNS match claim and exact accounts.users[].user syntax under TLS mapping were NOT parse-checked with nats-server -t nor confirmed against current NATS docs this session — reasoned from the mapping-order rule. Still the top risk."
  - id: accounts-in-leaf-conf
    risk: high
    claim: "accounts{} can live in leaf.conf alongside a leafnodes.remotes block"
    unknown: "validity of accounts{} in leaf.conf, and how leaf-local client identities reconcile with hub accounts, is unverified."
  - id: jetstream-api-subjects
    risk: high
    claim: "minimal per-account JetStream subject set: $JS.API.CONSUMER.>, $JS.API.STREAM.INFO.>, $JS.ACK.> (+ $JS.API.> for the stream creator)"
    unknown: "plausible but only validated by the proposed functional tests, which were NOT run; under-scoping silently breaks consumer/ack ops."
  - id: step-ca-san-flag
    risk: medium
    claim: "step ca certificate <role>.homeric ... --san <role>.homeric issues a client-auth cert with the needed DNS SAN"
    unknown: "illustrative — exact flags/profile for the client-auth EKU were not verified against the installed step-ca version."
  - id: accounts-syntax
    risk: medium
    claim: "the accounts{} example (nested permissions, deny lists) is valid NATS config"
    unknown: "written from memory of NATS config format; NOT parse-checked with nats-server -t."

| Project | Context | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HomericIntelligence/Odysseus | 2026-06-19 planning + review session (v1.1.0) | Plan written from on-disk reads of `configs/nats/{server,leaf}.conf` and submodule client config (Hermes/Telemachy); TLS confirmed present (ADR-008); auth/authz gap confirmed via grep. R0 plan NOGO'd by a reviewer (bare-CN mapping bug) and REVISED → v1.1.0. Still NOT executed — no config applied, no `nats-server -t`, no functional auth test run. Verification: `unverified`. |
| HomericIntelligence/Odysseus | 2026-06-19 implementation session (v1.2.0) | Issue #176: token-based auth added to `configs/nats/server.conf` (TWO `authorization {}` blocks: one top-level for the client listener, one inside `leafnodes {}` for the leafnode listener) and `configs/nats/leaf.conf` (token in remotes). `tools/validate-nats-auth.sh` created with brace-depth awk block extractor. CI validator wired as a dedicated step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. PR #303 committed and pushed; CI passed. Verification: `verified`. |
