# Stale Documentation Audit and Broken Reference Repair

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-13 |
| **Objective** | Canonical workflow for auditing stale documentation and repairing broken references: drift audits, phantom-dir/dead-link removal, placeholder lifecycle, getting-started rewrites, tier-label fixes, anchor validation, ADR LoC figure updates, stale line-number citations |
| **Outcome** | Consolidated from 10 skills covering doc-drift audits, broken-reference repair, policy-violation audits, placeholder/stub lifecycle, monolith-rationale docs, CONTRIBUTING case-clash, and anchor validation; v1.1.0 adds ADR LoC drift pattern; v1.2.0 adds stale line-number citation audit and issue-body claim verification; v1.9.0 adds merge-method per-repo note, doc-drift consolidation PLANNING, count-set disambiguation, phantom-path remove-vs-redirect, git-tag version-currency guard, subpackage counting, and Pattern D drift-test fragility |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |

## When to Use

- A "Future Improvements" / "Future Work" section lists a feature that already shipped
- Docs state a metric (test count, coverage %, file/agent count) that disagrees with the codebase
- `CLAUDE.md` contradicts `pyproject.toml`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` on thresholds or policy
- External architecture docs describe a project's ecosystem role inaccurately
- A directory/file was removed but docs still reference the path (phantom dir / dead link)
- Documentation examples contain commands that violate repo policy (e.g. `--label`, `--no-verify`)
- Getting-started stubs contain fabricated APIs, placeholder prose, or malformed code fences
- Tier labels / version numbers in docs have drifted from the authoritative table
- Stub files contain only boilerplate and should be deleted, deferred, or rewritten
- An audit nitpick questions a monolithic file's organization and needs a documented rationale
- Both `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/contributing.md` exist with a circular cross-reference
- README/docs deep-link to specific installation headings and you need CI to catch broken anchors
- An ADR file (e.g. `docs/adr/`) cites LoC figures or percentage metrics that have drifted as the codebase grew since the ADR was authored; `CLAUDE.md` or other doc files repeat the same stale counts
- An issue claims a file "contains" a specific string — grep for that exact string before trusting the claim (issue bodies may have been written against an older version of main)
- A doc or test file references another file by line number (e.g. `install.sh:137–141`) — the cited line numbers may have shifted independently across files that reference the same construct
- **PLANNING** a doc-drift consolidation: two+ onboarding/setup blocks have drifted from a canonical recipe and you must write an implementation plan before touching files
- An audit flags a stale file/subpackage/skill/test count, but it is unclear *which set* the doc counts (documented packages vs filesystem dirs; skill DEFINITIONS vs every dir incl. `_`-prefixed partials) — disambiguate before assuming the number is arithmetically wrong
- You are **planning** (not yet executing) a phantom-path / stale-reference fix and must decide between *removing* the dead pointer and *redirecting* it, and want a confirm-then-fix audit recipe
- A dated currency claim (latest-released-version / last-updated) in a doc trails the git tag line and you want a CI-effective guard (one that actually runs, not silently skips)
- A README/CLAUDE.md directory tree omits or miscounts a subpackage and you must re-derive the true package count from the filesystem (not trust the doc's own number or the issue's)
- A doc states a stale released-version claim (e.g. `MIGRATION.md` says "latest released version is 0.9.2" but `git tag` shows v0.9.5) and you must sync it to the correct version authority — AND decide whether to add a drift-detection regression test (see §18 for the fragility traps before you couple a prose regex to a git-tag-derived authority)

```

**Universal rules**: count from code (never from other docs); use `Edit` with exact strings, not
whole-section rewrites; use `replace_all: true` when a stale phrase repeats; after fixing the
primary file, re-grep the whole corpus — stale copies survive in `docs/`, `references/notes.md`,
`docs/analysis-prompt.md`. Always Read a file before Editing it.

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Drift audit (counts, metrics, roles, contradictions)

Classify the staleness, then verify against an authoritative source before editing:

| Pattern | Symptom | Authoritative source |
| ------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| Future-work drift | Doc says "Planned" but `.py` exists | `ls`/`head` the file |
| Stale counts | README says N, actual is M | pytest collect / `find … \| wc -l` |
| Metric discrepancy | CLAUDE.md ≠ pyproject.toml | grep both files |
| Ecosystem role drift | External docs describe wrong role | `gh api orgs/<ORG>/repos` |
| Doc contradiction | Policy conflict across files | grep policy term |
| Citation §-drift | §-ref points to old §-number | global mapping table + WebFetch per arXiv ID |
| ADR LoC drift | ADR cites old `N LoC / M% of codebase`; codebase has grown | `find … -name '*.py' \| xargs wc -l \| tail -1` — re-measure at implementation time |
| Line-number citation drift | Doc/test cites `file.sh:N–M`; construct moved after code churn | `grep -n <guard_pattern> <file>` to find current line; then `grep -rn "old_N\|old_M"` across all referencing files |
| Issue-body fabricated claim | Issue says file "contains" a string that no longer exists in main | `grep -n "<exact claimed string>" <file>` before planning; returns nothing → issue written against older main |

Fix patterns: `Planned → Implemented` in status tables; round counts with `+` for forward
compatibility (`"2026+ tests" → "3,000+ tests"`) but exact counts (no `+`) for deterministic
sums; correct `--cov` path to the installed package name. Annotate deleted entries with
strikethrough rather than removing them: `~~`.claude/agents/deleted.md`~~ — converted to skill`.
Add a self-verifying command to the doc so future readers can re-check:
`` `ls .github/workflows/*.yml | wc -l` ``. Authority order for contradictions:
`CLAUDE.md > .claude/shared/pr-workflow.md > CONTRIBUTING.md` — edit only the wrong file.

**ADR LoC drift (extended pattern)**: When an audit flags that an ADR's LoC figures are stale:

1. **Re-measure at implementation time** — never use figures from the issue body (they reflect the audit
   snapshot, not the current state). Run `find <package> -name '*.py' | xargs wc -l | tail -1` directly.
2. **Use content-match grep, not line numbers** — issue bodies cite line numbers from the audit snapshot;
   those numbers are stale by the time you implement. Find the actual string with
   `grep -rn "<old_figure>" docs/ CLAUDE.md README.md`.
3. **Read the ADR before planning** — the ADR may document why decomposition is rejected and identify
   the already-implemented remedy (e.g., an optional-extra install boundary). The correct fix may be
   documentation-only, not structural refactoring.
4. **Grep the whole corpus** — the same stale figure often appears in both the ADR and `CLAUDE.md`
   (and possibly `README.md`). Fix all occurrences in one PR.
5. **Skip `ruff check` for doc-only changes** — `ruff` does not lint `.md` files; the run is a no-op.
   Use `markdownlint-cli2` instead: `pixi run pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files <file.md>`.

**Example** — agent count drift after agents converted to skills: update both the Quick Links
bullet (`- N agents` → `- M agents`) and the Agent Hierarchy line (`All N agents` → `All M agents`).

Optionally add a drift-detection regression test (see Results & Parameters) and an ADR.

#### 2. Phantom-directory references

A referenced path no longer exists. Find every hit, confirm the dir is gone, then fold or remove.

**Example** — `tests/integration/` was removed; integration-style tests now live in
`tests/unit/analysis/` (`test_integration.py`, `test_cop_integration.py`). Fix README test
categories by folding the count into Unit Tests with a clarifying note, and replace the dead
invocation:

```bash
# Before:  pixi run pytest tests/integration/ -v   # Integration tests
# After:   pixi run pytest tests/unit/analysis/ -v # Includes integration-style tests
```

Verify clean: `grep -r "tests/integration" docs/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md` returns nothing.
Archived snapshots (`docs/arxiv/` dryrun workspaces) are out of scope.

#### 3. Broken links and anchors

A directory/file was deleted but CLAUDE.md / other docs still link to it. Four edit categories
for a deleted-directory case: (a) Quick Links bullets → remove dead links; (b) narrative
`See [file](path)` → plain text describing the current location; (c) Documentation Rules → update
path from removed dir to current dir; (d) Architecture tree → remove the removed-dir block.

**Example** — after `agents/` was deleted in a refactor, replace
`See [agents/hierarchy.md](agents/hierarchy.md)` with
`Agent hierarchy is defined in .claude/agents/ and tests/claude-code/shared/agents/`. Verify the
old refs are gone and the new location is mentioned.

**Anchor validation (CI)** — when docs deep-link to specific headings
(`installation.md#prerequisites`), add a focused additive script implementing GitHub's slug
algorithm; do NOT modify an existing `validate_links.py` that intentionally strips anchors.

```python
def heading_to_anchor(heading: str) -> str:
    slug = heading.lower().replace(" ", "-")
    slug = re.sub(r"[^a-z0-9\-]", "", slug)     # strip non-alphanumeric except hyphen
    slug = re.sub(r"-{2,}", "-", slug)          # collapse consecutive hyphens
    return slug.strip("-")
```

Plain links (no `#`) are always valid; only fragments are checked against the set of computed
heading anchors. Edge cases: `` `pixi install` fails `` → `pixi-install-fails`;
`Run Tests (without shell)` → `run-tests-without-shell`; `Step 1 Setup` → `step-1-setup`. Add a
step to `.github/workflows/link-check.yml` after the lychee step. Test hermetically with
`TemporaryDirectory` (portable in class-based tests where `tmp_path` fixtures aren't injected).

#### 4. Placeholder / stub lifecycle (delete · defer · annotate · rewrite)

```text
Stub has only boilerplate ("Content here.")?  → Delete (YAGNI) after grep -rl for referencers
Index lost a section after stub deletion?      → Insert HTML-comment placeholder + tracking issue
Future Improvements has bare bullets?          → Annotate each: Status / Why deferred / Acceptance
Placeholder must hold real content?            → Verify paths+APIs first, then rewrite
Real installation doc missing a section?       → Extend (e.g. add ## IDE Setup before Troubleshooting)
```

Do NOT use on auto-generated files, in-flight WIP, or when only one link is missing (inline TODO).

**Example — deferred index placeholder** (HTML comment passes markdownlint MD033, as comments
are not HTML elements):

```markdown
<!-- DEFERRED: Advanced Topics section
  Source files were placeholder stubs deleted in #<issue> (YAGNI). Re-add each entry
  once the corresponding doc is written.
  - <topic> (<path>) — Status: Deferred; Why: stub deleted in #<issue>
  Tracking issue: #<follow-up>
-->
```

**Example — annotate Future Improvements**: inspect implementation files first (Dockerfile,
scripts, source); for each item write `Status` / `Why deferred` / `Acceptance criteria`
sub-bullets, and surface already-implemented items with a source reference.

#### 5. Getting-started rewrite (codebase-grounded)

Never invent commands or APIs. Source recipes from `justfile`, versions from `pixi.toml`, and
verify every import exists by grepping the codebase (read `__init__.mojo`/package index, not
aspirational `EXAMPLES.md`). When the APIs shown don't exist yet, rewrite as a conceptual
orientation (what exists today / what is planned / how to use what exists) rather than fabricating.

**Example** — `first_model.md` imported `TensorDataset`, `Trainer`, `EarlyStopping` that don't
exist in `shared/`; full rewrite (760 → 252 lines) replacing them with real recipes. Use the
version *range* from `pixi.toml` (`mojo >= 0.26.1, < 0.27`), never a nightly build string.

Common lint fixes: MD001 (h5 after h3 — flatten inner subsections or demote `#####` to `####`);
MD040 (add a language tag); fix malformed fences (one open delimiter, one language tag, one close).

#### 6. Tier-label / version fixes

Labels drift off-by-one from the authoritative table after a renumbering. Scan ALL occurrences
(prior partial fixes are common — issues recur), then cross-check each against the table.

Authoritative tiers: T0 Prompts · T1 Skills · T2 Tooling · T3 Delegation · T4 Hierarchy · T5
Hybrid · T6 Super.

**Example** — `.claude/shared/metrics-definitions.md` had `T3 (Tooling)`, `T4 (Delegation)`,
`T5 (Hierarchy)`: fix to `T2 / T3 / T4`. Hotspots: the Token Tracking section (`T2 vs T3
Analysis` → `T1 vs T2`) and the 9-row Component Cost table. Only named references (`(Name)` or
`-` dashes) need fixing; bare tier numbers in formula example data are correct as-is.

#### 7. Audit-nitpick: monolith rationale (optional)

When a nitpick questions a monolithic file's SRP, document the rationale instead of splitting.
Fact-verify claims with grep (mechanism ≠ usage — "can be sourced" ≠ "is sourced anywhere").
Identify the pillars that make splitting expensive (shared state/counters, a unified filter, an
aggregated summary), add a short architecture comment block to the source pointing to a standalone
ADR (`docs/<COMPONENT>_ARCHITECTURE.md`), include accuracy caveats for any unverified claim, and
list triggers that would justify revisiting. Verify zero external callers with a negative grep.

#### 8. CONTRIBUTING case-clash redirect (optional)

When both root `CONTRIBUTING.md` (canonical) and `docs/contributing.md` exist with a circular
"See also" ↔ "Canonical source" reference, reduce the docs copy to a 5-line redirect and strip
the back-reference from root. Reduce to a redirect rather than deleting (preserves inbound links);
keep root canonical (it is the GitHub-visible file).

#### 9. Policy-violation audit (optional)

Scan only fenced shell code blocks (never prose, to avoid matching prohibition text). Rules:
`gh pr create --label`, `git commit --no-verify`, `gh pr merge --merge/--squash`,
`git push origin main`. Exclude archived paths (`docs/arxiv/`, `tests/claude-code/`, `.pixi/`,
`build/`). Anchor command rules to line starts and exclude `#`-commented lines (intentional
"BLOCKED" demonstrations are not violations). Add a regression test per new pattern.

### Validate, Commit, and PR

```bash
git diff --stat                                  # confirm only intended files changed
pre-commit run --all-files                       # runs markdownlint with precise line numbers
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "docs(<scope>): <description>

Closes #<issue>"
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "docs(<scope>): <description>" --body "Closes #<issue>"
gh pr merge --auto --rebase
```

### Disambiguate a flagged count (which set does the doc count?)

**Disambiguate WHICH set is counted before bumping a number.** A doc count flagged as stale can
disagree with `find … | wc -l` for two different reasons: (a) genuine staleness (a real dir was
added and never documented), or (b) the doc counts a *narrower set on purpose* (documented
packages, skill DEFINITIONS, public modules) that legitimately differs from the raw filesystem
count. Before editing, run BOTH a structural count AND a "what does the surrounding text
enumerate?" check, then reconcile three numbers — dir count, definition-file count, total-file
count — with the doc's claimed unit. Use `git ls-files <path>` to confirm a grep hit is actually
tracked (worktree mirrors false-positive with raw `grep -rn`). Exclude `.claude/worktrees/` when
re-grepping the corpus (`grep -v ".claude/worktrees/"`).

#### 10. Doc-drift consolidation PLANNING (proposed)

> **Warning:** This workflow has not been validated end-to-end. Treat as a hypothesis until CI confirms.

Use when an issue asks you to *consolidate* two or more drifted onboarding/setup blocks onto a
single canonical recipe and you must produce an **implementation plan** before editing. The core
durable lesson: **the issue's cited file:line ranges are frequently STALE and the duplicated
content frequently appears in MORE places than the issue cites — always re-grep directory-wide
and verify every line number on disk before planning any edit.**

Proposed planning steps:

1. **Distrust the issue's line numbers.** Do not plan against `file.md:34-45` from the issue body.
   `grep -n` for the actual heading or recipe and confirm where it really lives.

   ```bash
   # Issue claimed canonical block at CONTRIBUTING.md:34-45; reality:
   grep -n "just bootstrap\|^## Development Setup" CONTRIBUTING.md   # → 53-65, NOT 34-45
   ```

2. **Directory-wide grep, never single-file, to find ALL copies.** The issue usually cites one
   drifted block; there are often more.

   ```bash
   grep -rn "pre-commit install\|pixi install" README.md CONTRIBUTING.md docs/
   # Cited block: README.md:54-61. Grep ALSO found README:130-138
   # ("Setup Development Environment") with the SAME drift — patching only the
   # cited block would have left the drift alive.
   ```

3. **Classify each grep hit by surrounding context** before deciding to edit. Incidental keyword
   matches are not drift. (e.g. README:50/252/515 matched `pixi install` but were an extras note,
   a dependency-add example, and a branch-protection example — correctly left untouched.)

4. **Source ground truth for the canonical command from the authoritative file — never invent it.**

   ```bash
   sed -n '20,24p' justfile   # bootstrap recipe: pixi install / pixi run dev-install / pixi run pre-commit install
   ```

   The README was "subtly wrong" precisely because it predated `dev-install` and the
   `pixi run pre-commit` wrapper — read the recipe, do not reconstruct it from memory.

5. **Reduce-to-redirect, do not delete.** Keep the section heading + anchor and replace the command
   block with a pointer to the canonical recipe. This preserves inbound anchors and reading flow.

6. **Verify the redirect target anchor resolves.** When a redirect points at
   `CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup`, add a plan step that confirms the GitHub-rendered slug exists.

   ```bash
   grep -n "^## Development Setup" CONTRIBUTING.md   # confirms the #development-setup anchor
   ```

7. **Gate:** docs-only change → markdownlint is the only gate (MD032 blanks-around-lists is the
   usual offender); no unit tests.

#### 10. Doc-version-currency sync + drift-test fragility (Pattern D) — UNVERIFIED

> **Warning:** This sub-section is a **planning hypothesis** from ProjectHephaestus #1208 — the
> plan was NOT executed (no edits applied, no tests run, no CI). The drift-test fragility modes
> below are reasoning, not observed CI failures. Treat the drift-test recommendation as a caution,
> not a verified recipe. The *sync* half (find the authority, edit the prose, distinguish currency
> claims from historical references) follows the same verified mechanics as §1.

A doc names a stale released version (`MIGRATION.md`: "latest released version is **0.9.2**" while
`git tag` shows `v0.9.5`). Two parts: (a) **sync the prose to the version authority**, and
(b) **decide whether to add a drift-detection regression test** — the trap is that such a test is
fragile and can red CI for reasons unrelated to the doc being wrong.

**(a) Verify the version authority FIRST — do not trust a precedent skill's source-of-truth.**
In a **hatch-vcs** repo the canonical version is the latest git tag, NOT a static
`[project].version` (that field does not exist — `pyproject.toml` declares `dynamic = ["version"]`):

```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1          # the real authority in a hatch-vcs repo
grep -n "version" pyproject.toml | head      # confirm there is NO static [project].version
```

The sibling skill `security-md-version-sync` assumes `pyproject.toml [project].version` is the
source of truth — that is **WRONG for a hatch-vcs repo**. Always confirm the version authority for
*this* repo before reusing any precedent.

**(a cont.) Scope precisely, and distinguish currency claims from historical references.** Grep the
version AND any associated date, but do not blindly edit every hit:

```bash
grep -rn "0\.9\.2\|2026-05-28" docs/ README.md CLAUDE.md   # find every candidate
```

A match like `ROADMAP.md:9 … "the strict 2026-05-28 audit"` names a **historical event**, not a
current-version claim — editing it would be wrong. **Edit currency claims; leave historical
references that legitimately name a past date/version.**

**(b) Drift-detection regression test — three fragility modes (anti-patterns, do NOT ship blindly).**
The tempting test asserts the MIGRATION.md prose names the latest git tag, e.g. via a helper like
`hephaestus/version/consistency._version_from_git_tag` and a regex
`latest released version is \*\*(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\*\*`. It is fragile because:

1. **Regex brittleness** — the regex is coupled to exact prose + bold markup. A future copy-edit
   ("the most recent release is …") or removing `**` makes the test RED even though the doc is
   *correct*. The test now guards the wording, not the version.
2. **Silent skip on shallow CI checkout** — `_version_from_git_tag` returns `None` when tags aren't
   fetched (common with `actions/checkout` `fetch-depth: 1` / no `fetch-tags: true`). A
   `pytest.skip` on `None` means **the gate silently does nothing** — it can pass forever while the
   doc drifts. **A guard that skips in CI is not a guard.**
3. **Release-time race** — asserting the doc `==` latest tag turns every new `vX.Y.Z` push into a
   RED main until someone edits the doc. Pattern D ("stop maintaining the number") ironically
   **re-introduces a manual chore**: now you must edit the doc with/before every tag or main breaks.

**Mitigations (Proposed — not yet verified):**

- **Prefer a live source over an assertion.** Make the doc *link* to GitHub Releases / `git tag`
  output instead of hardcoding a number. This kills the maintenance burden with no brittle gate —
  the same "stop maintaining the number" philosophy used for badge/count drift (see the badges
  skill), applied to version prose.
- If a test is used, assert the doc version is **`<=` latest tag** (drift-direction guard), not
  `==`, so a fresh release tag does not instantly red main.
- If `_version_from_git_tag` returns `None` in CI, **fail loud or fetch tags** (`fetch-tags: true`)
  — never silently `skip`. A loud `xfail`/explicit-fail with a message beats a green no-op.

### Validate, Commit, and PR (Version Currency)

```bash
git diff --stat                                  # confirm only intended files changed
pre-commit run --all-files                       # runs markdownlint with precise line numbers
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "docs(<scope>): <description>

Closes #<issue>"
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "docs(<scope>): <description>" --body "Closes #<issue>"
gh pr merge --auto --rebase
```

#### Variant: doc-version-currency guard anchored to the git TAG (hatch-vcs repos)

When a doc carries a *currency claim* (e.g. "the latest released version is **0.9.5**" or
"Last updated: 0.9.5") that must not trail the real release, the authority is the **latest
`vX.Y.Z` git tag**, NOT `pyproject.toml`. A hatch-vcs / dynamic-versioning repo has **no static
`[project].version`** field, so the older `security-md-version-sync` pattern (pyproject as source
of truth) is WRONG here and must be rejected. Three non-obvious rules — apply ALL THREE:

1. **Authority = the git tag**, resolved with the project's own helper (do not re-implement):

   ```python
   from hephaestus.version.consistency import _version_from_git_tag   # "0.9.5" (leading v stripped)
   from hephaestus.version.parsing import parse_version_tuple          # ("0","9","5") -> (0, 9, 5)

   canonical = _version_from_git_tag(repo_root)   # internally: git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match 'v[0-9]*'
   ```

2. **Compare with `>=` / "does-not-trail", NEVER `==`.** Drift = the doc trailing the tag:

   ```python
   documented_tuple = parse_version_tuple(documented, on_non_numeric="raise")
   canonical_tuple  = parse_version_tuple(canonical,  on_non_numeric="raise")
   assert documented_tuple >= canonical_tuple, (
       f"doc trails git tag: documented {documented} < tag {canonical}"
   )
   ```

   `==` reintroduces a release-time race: a freshly-pushed *newer* tag would instantly red `main`
   before anyone edits the doc. With `>=`, "doc merely not ahead" passes; only a doc that has
   fallen *behind* fails.

3. **The guard must RUN in CI — a `pytest.skip` is a silent no-op gate** that guards nothing.
   - **WARN/comment + assert-not-None on the regex** (POLA): the regex
     (`r"latest released version is \*\*(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\*\*"`) is coupled to the exact doc
     wording. Put an in-code `# WARNING:` comment above it telling future editors to update it in
     lockstep with the doc phrasing, and `assert match is not None` so a reword fails LOUD, not silent.
   - **Absent tags → hard `pytest.fail(...)`, never `pytest.skip`** — with remediation guidance
     (run `git fetch --tags`; set `fetch-tags: true`). If the workflow ever regresses to a
     tag-less checkout, the test goes RED loudly instead of green-but-skipped.

   ```python
   def test_doc_version_not_behind_git_tag(repo_root: Path) -> None:
       canonical = _version_from_git_tag(repo_root)
       if canonical is None:
           pytest.fail(  # NOT pytest.skip — a skip makes this guard a no-op
               "No vX.Y.Z git tag reachable. CI checkout must be deep + tagged: "
               "run `git fetch --tags` locally; in the workflow set "
               "`fetch-depth: 0` and `fetch-tags: true` on actions/checkout."
           )
       text = (repo_root / "MIGRATION.md").read_text()
       # WARNING: this regex is coupled to MIGRATION.md's exact wording.
       # If you reword that sentence, update this pattern IN LOCKSTEP.
       match = re.search(r"latest released version is \*\*(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\*\*", text)
       assert match is not None, "MIGRATION.md currency sentence reworded — update the regex"
       documented = match.group(1)
       assert parse_version_tuple(documented, on_non_numeric="raise") >= parse_version_tuple(
           canonical, on_non_numeric="raise"
       ), f"MIGRATION.md version {documented} trails git tag {canonical}"
   ```

   The companion fix lives in the **workflow**, not the test: the unit-test job's
   `actions/checkout` step needs `fetch-depth: 0` + `fetch-tags: true` (a bare checkout is shallow
   and tag-less, so `_version_from_git_tag` returns `None`). Mirror the config already in
   `auto-tag.yml` / `release.yml`.

   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/checkout@<sha>
     with:
       fetch-depth: 0      # full history
       fetch-tags: true    # tags are required for _version_from_git_tag
   ```

   **TDD non-skip discipline:** the RED step must assert the test FAILS (`1 failed`) against the
   stale state — explicitly NOT "1 skipped" masquerading as a pass. GREEN runs with `-rs` and
   asserts `0 skipped`.

   **Distinguish a currency claim from a historical event name:** "Last updated: <date>" is a
   currency claim to sync; "the strict <date> audit" is an *event name* — leave it untouched.

   **Test placement:** a new `tests/unit/docs/` dir does NOT trip a one-directional source↔test
   mirror-structure check (no `hephaestus/docs/` source is required), and the no-loose-files check
   is satisfied because the test lives inside a subpackage.

### Reliable markdownlint invocation

```bash
# WORKS
pixi run pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files <path/to/file.md>
pre-commit run --all-files
# FAILS — npx/just not in pixi conda env; pixi env init ~2 min
pixi run npx markdownlint-cli2 <file>
```

### Key parameters

- **Counts**: round + `+` for non-deterministic (`3,000+`); exact (no `+`) for deterministic sums.
- **Mojo version in docs**: range from `pixi.toml` (`>=0.26.1,<0.27`), never a nightly string.
- **HTML comments** pass MD033 (comments aren't elements) — safe for deferred-section placeholders.
- **Files most likely to hold stale refs**: `docs/index.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/glossary.md`,
  `references/notes.md`, `docs/analysis-prompt.md`.
- **Policy-audit exclusions**: `docs/arxiv/`, `tests/claude-code/`, `.pixi/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`.
- **Doc-version authority on hatch-vcs repos**: the latest `vX.Y.Z` git tag (via
  `_version_from_git_tag`), NOT `pyproject.toml` — there is no static `[project].version` field.
  `security-md-version-sync`'s pyproject-as-source-of-truth assumption does NOT apply to
  dynamic-versioning repos.

#### 1b. Counting subpackages for a directory-tree drift fix (planning)

> **Warning:** This subsection is `unverified` — derived from an implementation *plan* for
> ProjectHephaestus #1188 (README directory tree omits the `scripts_lib/` subpackage). The plan was
> not executed end-to-end (no pre-commit run, no regression test executed). Treat the counting

When a README/CLAUDE.md directory tree omits a subpackage and quotes a package count, **re-derive
the count from the filesystem yourself** — trust neither the doc's claim nor the audit issue's
number. Both can carry the same off-by-one error.

```bash
# WRONG — overcounts: includes __pycache__/ and any dot-dirs
ls -d hephaestus/*/ | wc -l            # returned 21 (20 real + __pycache__)

# RIGHT — count only real packages (those with an __init__.py)
find hephaestus -maxdepth 2 -name __init__.py -printf '%h\n' | sort -u | wc -l
# or, tracked files only (ignores cache entirely):
git ls-files 'hephaestus/*/__init__.py' | wc -l   # → 20
```

Then re-grep the **bare number** across the whole corpus and disambiguate every hit before editing —
the same stale count usually lives in more than one file, and an unrelated metric will false-positive:

```bash
grep -rn "19" README.md CLAUDE.md
# README.md:tree caption "19 ... subpackages"  → REAL stale copy (fix)
# CLAUDE.md:28 "19 documented subpackages"      → REAL second stale copy (fix)
# CLAUDE.md:62 "19.7k LoC"                       → FALSE POSITIVE, unrelated metric (do NOT change)
```

For the tree insertion itself, the new entry must sort into the existing order — verify the **local
neighborhood** is alphabetical (e.g. `scripts_lib/` sorts between `resilience/` and `system/`) by
reading the adjacent lines; do not assume the entire tree is sorted. The inserted comment text is
planner-authored prose, not a copied docstring — flag it for maintainer wording review. The real
acceptance gate is a regression test that asserts every `*/__init__.py` package appears in the tree,
not the greps (the greps are for human/CI reproduction). The CLAUDE.md "avoid raw grep" guidance
applies to agent tool-use, not to a doc's copy-paste verification block.

## Planning Discipline (remove-vs-redirect + confirm-then-fix)

> **Verification of this section:** `verified-local`. The audit/verification *technique* below was
> directly verified on disk (`ls .claude/` proved `.claude/shared/` is absent; `grep -rn` found one
> tracked occurrence). The downstream PR outcome is **pending** — the plan that produced this

### Remove-vs-redirect decision rule

When a doc points at a path/file/section that no longer exists, choose deliberately:

| Situation | Action | Why |
| --------- | ------ | --- |
| An **adjacent surviving line already covers the same intent** | **REMOVE** the dead pointer | KISS/YAGNI — the redirect would be pure redundancy |
| **No surviving pointer covers the intent** and the information would otherwise be lost | **REDIRECT** to the current location | Preserves the reader's path to the information |

**Worked example** (ProjectHephaestus #1211): `CLAUDE.md` "Getting Help" list item 4 pointed at
`.claude/shared/` (a phantom dir). The adjacent item 3 (`CLAUDE.md:415`, "Review documentation in
`docs/` directory") already covered the shared-docs intent, so item 4 was redundant → **remove**,
not redirect.

### Confirm-then-fix audit sequence (the verified-local technique)

1. `grep -rn "<stale-string>" . --include="*.md"` — find **every** hit across the whole tree, not
   just the line the audit cited.
2. `ls <path>` — prove the directory/file is actually absent (don't trust the audit's claim).
3. Check whether an **adjacent line already covers the intent** → drives remove-vs-redirect.
4. Make a **minimal single-line `Edit`** (don't rewrite the section).
5. **Re-grep the whole corpus** before declaring done — sibling stale copies (worktree mirrors,
   `docs/` duplicates) survive a single-line patch.

### Reviewer-risk checklist for the resulting plan

Surface these as explicit risks; each is a place where a phantom-path plan commonly goes wrong:

- **Ephemeral / worktree copies.** A `.claude/worktrees/agent-*/CLAUDE.md` mirror is often assumed
  out-of-scope (regenerated/discarded by the worktree lifecycle) but that assumption is rarely
  verified. Run `git ls-files <path> | head` to confirm it is **untracked** before excluding it; if
  it is tracked, the plan misses an occurrence.
- **Line numbers drift.** An audit's cited `file:N` (e.g. `CLAUDE.md:417`) can shift between the
  audit date and the edit. Mitigation: re-`grep -n` on disk and edit by matched string, never by the
  audit's stale line number.
- **Markdownlint blank-line regressions.** Deleting a list item can trip MD022/MD032 — reason about
  it, but the proof is `pre-commit run markdownlint --files <file>`, not inspection.
- **Memory-sourced external invariants.** Policy facts pulled from prior memory rather than
  re-verified this session (e.g. the `pr-policy` auto-merge gate requiring a `state:implementation-go`
  label; the GPG committer-email-must-match-key rule; a specific signing email) should be flagged as
  assumed-from-memory so the reviewer re-confirms them against the live repo config.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Fixing only the primary file for stale counts | Updated README but not `docs/` or `references/` | Stale copies survived in `docs/analysis-prompt.md` and `references/notes.md` | Always re-run a project-wide grep after fixing the primary file |
| Deleting stub/tracking entries outright | `rm` stubs / removed deleted-agent lines immediately | Left broken links across docs and lost historical context | grep `-rl` for all referencers first; use `~~strikethrough~~` for converted entries |
| Keeping fabricated APIs in getting-started docs | Preserved `TensorDataset`, `Trainer`, `EarlyStopping` imports | Those types don't exist in `shared/`; docs mislead and fail when run | grep the codebase to verify every API/import before keeping it |
| `#####` subsections inside a `####` block containing `###` headings | Kept original heading structure | markdownlint MD001: a `###` resets the running level, so the next `#####` jumps 2 levels | Flatten inner subsections to bold, or demote `#####` to `####` |
| Hardcoding the Mojo nightly version string | Wrote `0.26.1.0.dev2025122805` | Full nightly strings go stale immediately | Use the version range from `pixi.toml` (`>=0.26.1,<0.27`) |
| Editing the SHA-pinning documentation examples | Considered replacing `setup-pixi@v0.9.3` in pinning examples | Those lines document the pattern; they are not workflow steps to migrate | Distinguish concept-explaining code blocks from actual steps |
| Modifying `validate_links.py` to also check anchors | Extending the existing script | It intentionally strips anchors for file-existence checks; changing it breaks callers | Create a focused additive anchor script instead |
| Sourceable-contract / mechanism tests as monolith justification | Cited a source guard and ran `source … && type fn` to "prove" usage | Mechanism (can be sourced) ≠ usage (zero actual callers per grep); baking it into docs misleads auditors | Verify usage with grep; demote unverified claims to caveats |
| Removing `--label` from CONTRIBUTING without checking `.claude/shared/` | Only grepped `CONTRIBUTING.md` | A third file (`.claude/shared/pr-workflow.md`) could hold the same contradiction | Verify all related files before declaring a contradiction fixed |
| `replace_all: false` for a repeated phrase | Tried editing the first occurrence individually | Context string not unique — Edit reported "string not found" | Use `replace_all: true` when the same phrase appears multiple times |
| `pixi run npx markdownlint-cli2 <file>` / `just pre-commit-all` | Linting via npx or `just` | `npx`/`just` not in PATH; pixi env init takes ~2 min | Run `pre-commit run` (or `git commit`) to trigger markdownlint directly |
| Full pre-commit suite without skipping | Ran all hooks on a host with a GLIBC mismatch | `mojo-format` fails on GLIBC < 2.32 (environment, not code) | Use `SKIP=mojo-format`; only non-Mojo hooks matter for doc-only changes |
| Trusting issue body LoC figures for ADR updates | Used `25,403 / 46,697 = 54.4%` from the audit-generated issue body | Figures reflected the audit snapshot date, not the current on-disk state; re-measurement gave `26,125 / 48,498 = 53.9%` | Always re-measure LoC from disk at implementation time with `find … -name '*.py' \| xargs wc -l \| tail -1` |
| Using issue body line numbers to locate stale text in ADR | Jumped to `:9` / `:62` as cited in the issue | Issue line numbers were from the audit snapshot; the actual strings had shifted | Use content-match grep (`grep -rn "<old_figure>"`) to locate stale text — never trust issue-body line numbers |
| Planning structural decomposition for an ADR's god-package finding | Proposed splitting the `automation/` package before reading ADR-0001 | ADR-0001 explicitly documents that decomposition is rejected; the prescribed remedy (optional-extra install boundary) was already implemented | Read the referenced ADR in full before planning — it may document that the finding is intentional design with an approved alternative remedy; correct fix may be documentation-only |
| Running `pixi run ruff check docs/ CLAUDE.md` for doc-only changes | Ran ruff on markdown files expecting linting feedback | `ruff` does not lint `.md` files; the command is a no-op and produces no signal | Skip `ruff check` for doc-only changes; use `pixi run pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files <file.md>` instead |
| Deleting `docs/contributing.md` to resolve the case-clash | Removed the file entirely | Breaks inbound links from the docs index | Reduce to a redirect; keep root as canonical |
| Per-file reviewers for citation corpus | Reviewed each entry individually | Could not see cross-document §-drift or arXiv ID-to-title swaps | Both failure modes need a cross-corpus structural audit, not per-file review |
| Trusting issue body claim of specific incorrect string | Planned to remove text the issue said was "incorrect" in a doc | That exact text no longer existed in main — a prior PR had already fixed it; issue body was written against an older version | Grep for the exact claimed string before planning any edit; if grep returns nothing the issue premise is stale |
| `pytest.skip` when no git tag is reachable | Skipped the doc-version drift test on a tag-less CI checkout | Silent no-op gate — the headline drift guard then guards nothing (green-but-skipped) | Make absent-tags a hard `pytest.fail(...)` with remediation, AND add `fetch-tags: true` so the test actually runs |
| `==`-to-latest-tag for the version-currency assert | `assert documented == canonical_tag` | Release-time race: a freshly-pushed newer tag instantly reds `main` before anyone edits the doc | Use `>=` / "does-not-trail" semantics — doc merely "not ahead" passes, only a trailing doc fails |
| Using pyproject `[project].version` as the authority on a hatch-vcs repo | Tried to read the canonical version from `pyproject.toml` | hatch-vcs / dynamic versioning has NO static `[project].version` field — `security-md-version-sync`'s pyproject-as-source assumption does not apply | Authority is the latest git tag via `_version_from_git_tag(repo_root)` |
| Bare `actions/checkout` for a job whose tests need tags | Left the default shallow checkout on the unit-test job | A bare checkout is shallow and tag-less, so `_version_from_git_tag` returns `None` and the guard skips/fails | Add `fetch-depth: 0` + `fetch-tags: true` (mirror auto-tag.yml / release.yml) |
| Regex coupled to doc wording with no guard | Relied on the regex silently returning no match after a reword | A reworded sentence makes the regex match nothing → test passes vacuously, drift undetected | `assert match is not None` (fail loud on reword) + an in-code `# WARNING:` comment to update the regex in lockstep |
| Searching only the issue-reported stale line-number value | Only grepped for `137-141` (the value cited in the issue) | The test file had a *different* stale value (`127-129`) from independent update history; missed it entirely | Search for all plausible old values across all referencing files — doc and test files may carry different stale numbers from independent update histories |

- **Merge method is per-repo policy** — verify squash vs rebase vs merge against the target repo's
  CLAUDE.md / branch-protection before copying any `gh pr merge` line. ProjectHephaestus: `--squash`
  (rebase disabled).
