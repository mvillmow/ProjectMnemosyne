# Inference360 Slurm Control-Node Allocation Debugging

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-26 |
| **Objective** | Explain why `uv run inference360 control up` was pending for a CPU control-node allocation and update the Inference360 control-node Slurm defaults. |
| **Outcome** | Successful. LLM360/Inference360 PR #286 fixed issue #285 and merged on 2026-06-26 after CI passed. |
| **Verification** | verified-ci. PR #286 passed `validate`, `secrets`, `sast`, `python-sca`, and CodeQL before auto-merge. Local host fallback validation also passed with 852 passed and 8 skipped; plain `just validate` was blocked locally only because rootless Podman was unavailable. |
| **History** | [changelog](./inference360-slurm-control-node-allocation-debugging.history) |

## When to Use

- `uv run inference360 control up` submits a Slurm control-node job that stays pending with `Reason=Priority`.
- The control job is CPU-only or `--gres=gpu:0`, but partition, account, QOS, or CPU request behavior is unclear.
- An interactive `srun` appears to start quickly, but the Inference360 control sbatch waits in a different Slurm scheduling lane.
- You need to verify that Inference360 manifest defaults for `slurm.control` produce the expected sbatch command.
- Existing pending Slurm jobs may have stale attributes after a manifest edit and need cancel/re-submit.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Inspect live queue state for the control job.
squeue -j "$JOB_ID" -o '%i|%T|%R|%P|%q|%b|%D|%C|%m|%l|%S|%u|%j'

# Inspect the full Slurm job record.
scontrol show job "$JOB_ID"

# Compare the candidate partitions directly.
scontrol show partition cpuonly
scontrol show partition main

# Compare an interactive user allocation with the Inference360 control sbatch.
srun -n 1 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:0 --pty bash
```

### Detailed Steps

1. Capture the live pending job with:

   ```bash
   squeue -j "$JOB_ID" -o '%i|%T|%R|%P|%q|%b|%D|%C|%m|%l|%S|%u|%j'
   ```

   Record the partition, QOS, GRES, node count, CPU count, memory, time limit, start time, user, job name, and pending reason.

2. Inspect the full job record with:

   ```bash
   scontrol show job "$JOB_ID"
   ```

   Do not rely on this alone to reveal the submitted wrap command. For the observed pending sbatch, `Command=(null)` was possible.

3. Compare the relevant Slurm partitions directly:

   ```bash
   scontrol show partition cpuonly
   scontrol show partition main
   ```

   Confirm relative size, priority, and policy instead of assuming that a GPU-free request picks a CPU partition.

4. Run or inspect a comparable interactive command:

   ```bash
   srun -n 1 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:0 --pty bash
   ```

   The key observation from issue #285 was that `--gres=gpu:0` did not select `cpuonly`. Without an explicit `--partition`, the interactive job landed on the default `main` partition, which had more capacity and a higher-priority scheduling path than `cpuonly`.

5. Compare that with the Inference360 manifest-driven sbatch. In the failing state, `manifests/clusters/m2.yaml` explicitly set `slurm.control.partition: cpuonly`, used account/QOS `k2m`, and had no explicit `slurm.control.cpus_per_task`. The control job queued with `Reason=Priority` despite requesting only 1 CPU.

6. Reconstruct the control sbatch command from `_control_sbatch_command` and the resolved manifest state when Slurm does not show the wrap details. Do not infer the command from interactive `srun` behavior.

7. Apply the default correction that matched the user's requested change:

   ```yaml
   slurm:
     control:
       partition: cpuonly
       qos: main
       account: main
       cpus_per_task: 32
   ```

   Important: keep `partition: cpuonly`. The requested fix was account/QOS `main` plus 32 CPUs for the control job, not switching the partition to `main`.

8. Add validation that any `slurm.*.cpus_per_task` field is a positive integer. This fails closed on invalid manifest values before sbatch generation.

9. Update `_control_sbatch_command` so it emits `--cpus-per-task=$VALUE` when the resolved control Slurm config includes `cpus_per_task`.

10. Add a regression test for `control up --cluster m2` showing the submitted command includes:

    ```text
    --qos=main
    --account=main
    --cpus-per-task=32
    ```

11. Cancel and re-submit any existing pending control job after changing the manifest. Pending Slurm jobs keep the attributes they were submitted with; they do not pick up new manifest defaults in place.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Infer partition from `--gres=gpu:0` | Treated an interactive `srun -n 1 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:0 --pty bash` placement as evidence that GPU-free requests target `cpuonly` | Without an explicit partition, the interactive job used the default `main` partition, not `cpuonly` | Always verify actual partition and QOS with `squeue` and `scontrol`; `--gres=gpu:0` is not a partition selector |
| Debug only the low CPU count | Focused on the pending control job requesting only 1 CPU | The pending reason was priority in the explicitly selected `cpuonly` partition with account/QOS `k2m`; CPU count alone did not explain the scheduling lane | Inspect partition, account, QOS, CPU count, and pending reason together |
| Expect Slurm to reveal the full wrapped command | Used `scontrol show job "$JOB_ID"` expecting to see every sbatch detail | The pending sbatch record could show `Command=(null)` | Reconstruct the command from `_control_sbatch_command` and resolved manifest state |
| Switch partition based on the interactive comparison | Considered the fast interactive job on `main` as evidence to move control jobs to `main` | The requested product change was account/QOS `main` and `cpus_per_task: 32` while keeping `partition: cpuonly` | Preserve the intended control-node partition unless the user or platform policy explicitly changes it |
| Wait for a pending job after editing the manifest | Left an already-submitted pending control job in place after updating defaults | Slurm jobs retain submit-time attributes | Cancel and re-submit control jobs to pick up manifest changes |

## Results & Parameters

### Manifest Correction

The verified correction in `manifests/clusters/m2.yaml` was:

```yaml
slurm:
  control:
    partition: cpuonly
    qos: main
    account: main
    cpus_per_task: 32
```

### Code and Test Contract

- Manifest validation must reject any `slurm.*.cpus_per_task` value that is not a positive integer.
- `_control_sbatch_command` must include `--cpus-per-task=$VALUE` when the resolved control Slurm config includes `cpus_per_task`.
- The `control up --cluster m2` regression must assert the submitted sbatch includes `--qos=main`, `--account=main`, and `--cpus-per-task=32`.

### Debug Evidence to Preserve

Use sanitized summaries in durable docs, issues, and PRs. Keep raw endpoint addresses, absolute infrastructure paths, checkpoint paths, tokens, cookies, private prompts, and other secrets out of shared learning artifacts.

| Evidence | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `squeue -j "$JOB_ID" -o '%i\|%T\|%R\|%P\|%q\|%b\|%D\|%C\|%m\|%l\|%S\|%u\|%j'` | Confirms state, reason, partition, QOS, GRES, node count, CPU count, and job name |
| `scontrol show job "$JOB_ID"` | Confirms full job attributes where available |
| `scontrol show partition cpuonly` and `scontrol show partition main` | Confirms partition policy differences directly |
| Resolved manifest state | Shows which partition, account, QOS, and CPU count Inference360 intended to submit |
| `_control_sbatch_command` output | Reconstructs the actual sbatch command when Slurm does not expose the wrap command |

### Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| LLM360/Inference360 | PR #286 for issue #285, merged 2026-06-26 | CI passed `validate`, `secrets`, `sast`, `python-sca`, and CodeQL before auto-merge. Local fallback validation passed with 852 passed and 8 skipped; rootless Podman unavailability blocked plain local `just validate` only. |
