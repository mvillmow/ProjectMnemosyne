# Planning: Verify the Issue Premise Before Implementing

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-19 |
| **Objective** | Capture durable planning discipline for issues whose premise names an artifact that may not exist on the working branch — verify existence REPO-WIDE (all branches) before concluding it was never built, read a check script's real runtime deps before asserting its CI env, and reduce judgment-call dispositions to deterministic runnable gates |
| **Outcome** | Plan REVISED for ProjectHermes #556 across THREE NOGO rounds. R1: the assumed `sync_requirements.py` + `requirements.txt` DO exist — on `origin/354-auto-impl`, not `main` — so the issue is VALID, blocked on merge ordering. But that R1 plan, graded A on quality, was STILL NOGO'd on one trigger: "correct but blocked on an external merge → not actionable today." R2 (v2.1.0): removed the blocker by making the PR SELF-CONTAINED — vendored a corrected `sync_requirements.py` and GENERATED `requirements.txt` from the CURRENT branch's own `pixi.lock` (`pixi list --json` → 96 pkgs), so the PR stands alone against `main` with no cross-PR ordering dependency. The earlier "re-scope/close" disposition (v1.0.0) was WRONG (corrected in v2.0.0); the "gate on #354 merging" disposition (R1) was correct-but-unactionable (corrected here). |
| **Verification** | unverified — PLANNING session only; no code written or executed end-to-end, no CI run, `pixi list --json` confirmed locally (96 pkgs) but the full generated `requirements.txt` and the Dockerfile `pip install -r` switch were NOT run end-to-end |
| **History** | v1.0.0 → v2.0.0 (MAJOR: worked-example conclusion overturned) → v2.1.0 (MINOR: adds the self-contained-vs-blocked-on-merge workflow step + the vendor-fixes-latent-bugs lesson). See `planning-verify-issue-premise-before-implementing.history`. |

This skill's own v1.0.0 example is a cautionary tale: it concluded the named artifacts
"never landed" from a single-branch `git ls-files`, and recommended re-scoping/closing the
issue. **That was wrong.** A scan across all remote branches found both files on the
prerequisite issue's `<n>-auto-impl` branch. The artifact was BUILT but not yet merged. The
disposition flipped from "close the issue" to "the issue is valid; it is blocked on merge
ordering." The three corrections below are the durable lessons.

## When to Use

- An issue's body cites a specific script, file, or committed config as already-existing context (e.g. "the existing `scripts/sync_requirements.py --check`" or "the committed `requirements.txt`").
- The issue is framed as a follow-up to a prior issue/PR (e.g. "follow-up from #354") whose deliverables you have not independently confirmed MERGED.
- You are about to conclude an artifact "never existed" / "never landed" from a check run only on the current working branch.
- Your plan would gate the next stage on an external/sibling PR merging ("do X after #N lands") — even at A-grade quality this is a NOGO ("correct but blocked on an external merge → not actionable today"); prefer making the PR self-contained.
- You are vendoring code or a list from another branch and could transcribe its latent bugs (especially a frozen allowlist that's supposed to mirror a live source of truth).
- The issue's stated failure mode depends on a build step or committed file you have not inspected.
- You are about to assert a CI job's toolchain needs (pixi / node / stdlib-only) without reading the check script's actual `subprocess`/`import`/external-tool calls.
- Your plan's central decision is a judgment call (re-scope, close, defer) that would require human sign-off rather than a runnable gate.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. EXISTENCE CHECK — REPO-WIDE, not just the current branch.
#    A current-branch miss does NOT prove "never built."
git ls-files | grep -iE 'requirements|sync_req'        # current branch only — INSUFFICIENT
git ls-tree -r origin/main --name-only | grep -iE 'requirements|sync_req'   # check main too
# ...then scan EVERY remote branch (the artifact often lives on the prereq issue's branch):
for b in $(git branch -r --format='%(refname:short)' | grep -v HEAD); do
  git ls-tree -r --name-only "$b" 2>/dev/null | grep -q sync_requirements \
    && echo "FOUND in $b"
done
# -> FOUND in origin/354-auto-impl   (built, not yet merged to main)

# 2. If found on a sibling branch, the issue is VALID. The merge-order fact is real:
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/354-auto-impl origin/main && echo MERGED || echo BLOCKED
# -> BLOCKED  (false exit) == #354 not yet in main.
# BUT: a plan that says "do X after #354 merges" is STILL a NOGO ("correct but blocked on an
# external merge → not actionable today"). The merge-base gate does NOT rescue it — the next
# stage cannot proceed today. DO NOT stack/wait. Make the PR SELF-CONTAINED instead (step 2b).

# 2b. SELF-CONTAINED: regenerate the prerequisite from sources ALREADY on your branch,
#     so the PR stands alone against main with no cross-PR ordering dependency.
pixi list --json > /tmp/pkgs.json   # confirmed locally: 96 pkgs from THIS branch's pixi.lock
#   -> generate requirements.txt from THIS branch's pixi.lock, commit it in THIS PR.
#   Only stack/wait if the prereq genuinely can't be reproduced (needs secrets/infra you lack).

# 2c. When VENDORING a script/list from another branch, FIX its latent bugs — don't transcribe.
git show origin/354-auto-impl:scripts/sync_requirements.py | grep -n '_RUNTIME_DEPS'
#   -> a hardcoded _RUNTIME_DEPS frozen set, ALREADY stale vs pyproject.toml (missing
#      starlette + urllib3, the latter pinned for a CVE). A frozen mirror of dynamic data is
#      latent drift BY CONSTRUCTION. Derive the runtime set live from pyproject.toml instead.

# 3. Read the check script's ACTUAL runtime deps BEFORE asserting its CI env:
git show origin/354-auto-impl:scripts/sync_requirements.py | grep -nE 'subprocess|import |pixi|node'
# -> subprocess.run(["pixi","list","--json"])  ==> needs pixi in CI (NOT a stdlib-only job)
# contrast: check_dep_sync.py is tomllib-only ==> pixi-free. SAME repo, OPPOSITE CI needs.
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Run existence checks REPO-WIDE before concluding an artifact "never landed."** A
   current-branch `git ls-files | grep` returning nothing is a BRANCH-scoped fact, not a
   REPO-scoped one. Check `origin/main` (`git ls-tree -r origin/main --name-only | grep`),
   then loop over every remote branch (`for b in $(git branch -r ... | grep -v HEAD); do
   git ls-tree -r --name-only "$b" | grep -q <artifact> && echo "FOUND in $b"; done`). For
   #556 this found `scripts/sync_requirements.py` and `requirements.txt` on
   `origin/354-auto-impl` — the prerequisite issue #354's own branch. The artifact was BUILT,
   not absent. **Issues are frequently the CI-wiring / integration tail of a sibling issue
   whose code lives on an unmerged branch.**

2. **When the artifact exists on an unmerged branch, the issue is "valid" — NOT re-scope/close.
   The merge-ordering fact is real (`git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/354-auto-impl
   origin/main` → false while #354 is unmerged) — but do NOT make it the plan's disposition.**

2a. **"Correct but blocked on an external merge" is itself a NOGO trigger — make the PR
   self-contained instead.** This is the PRIMARY R2 lesson. The R1 plan said "wire in
   `sync_requirements.py` + `requirements.txt`, gated on #354 merging." A reviewer graded it A on
   quality but NOGO'd on ONE trigger: the plan is correct but BLOCKED on an external merge → not
   actionable today / not "ready as-is." Crucially, the deterministic `git merge-base
   --is-ancestor` gate did NOT rescue it — a runnable gate that still evaluates to "blocked"
   leaves the next stage unable to proceed today. **The fix is NOT a better gate; it is removing
   the dependency.** Make the PR self-contained: reproduce the prerequisite INTO the current
   branch from sources already on it. For #556 the R2 plan vendored a corrected
   `sync_requirements.py` and GENERATED `requirements.txt` from the CURRENT branch's own
   `pixi.lock` (`pixi list --json`, confirmed locally → 96 pkgs) — one PR, no cross-PR ordering
   dependency. **Heuristic:** when an issue's prerequisite lives on an unmerged branch, prefer
   "reproduce the prerequisite locally from sources already on my branch" over "stack/wait."
   Only stack if the prerequisite genuinely cannot be regenerated (it needs secrets/infra you
   lack).

2b. **Vendoring a copy of code from another branch is a chance to FIX its latent bugs, not
   blindly transcribe.** This is the TERTIARY R2 lesson. #354's `sync_requirements.py` hardcoded
   a frozen `_RUNTIME_DEPS` set that was ALREADY stale vs the current branch's `pyproject.toml` —
   it omitted `starlette` and `urllib3` (the latter pinned for CVE-2026-44431/44432).
   Transcribing it verbatim would have silently dropped two runtime deps from the generated
   `requirements.txt`, re-creating the very drift the check exists to prevent. The fix: derive the
   runtime set from `pyproject.toml [project.dependencies]` dynamically instead of a frozen list.
   **Heuristic:** when you copy a list/set that's supposed to mirror another source of truth,
   replace the frozen copy with a read of the source of truth. A frozen mirror of dynamic data is
   latent drift by construction.

3. **Read the named check script's ACTUAL runtime dependencies before asserting its CI
   environment.** Do not generalize the toolchain of a superficially similar script in the same
   repo. `sync_requirements.py` shells out via `subprocess.run(["pixi","list","--json"])`, so its
   CI job REQUIRES pixi setup. The repo's other drift checker, `check_dep_sync.py`, is
   deliberately stdlib-only (`tomllib`) and runs pixi-free. **Two superficially similar
   "drift check" scripts had OPPOSITE runtime requirements.** Grep the script for `subprocess`,
   `import`, and external-tool names (`pixi`, `node`, `cargo`, ...) before deciding its job needs.

4. **Reduce a plan's central judgment call to a deterministic runnable check.** The v1.0.0 plan
   recommended re-scoping/closing #556 — a decision that "required human ratification." A plan
   reviewer NOGO'd it precisely because a discretionary sign-off blocks the next stage from
   auto-proceeding. Converting the decision into a hard, provable ordering dependency
   (`git merge-base --is-ancestor ...` → false = blocked) removed the NOGO. A deterministic gate
   the implementer can run is acceptable; a discretionary recommendation requiring sign-off is not.

5. **Still separate the literal ask from the intent — but only AFTER the repo-wide existence
   check.** v1.0.0 correctly noted that building a redundant artifact can violate a
   single-source-of-truth principle. That reasoning is sound ONLY when the artifact is genuinely
   absent or genuinely redundant. Here it was NEITHER — it existed on a sibling branch — so the
   "satisfy intent with existing tooling, decline to build" path did not apply. Verify existence
   repo-wide first; the intent-vs-literal analysis is downstream of that fact.

6. **Fetch linked/parent issues from the source of truth — and flag when you could not.** The
   #354 ↔ `354-auto-impl` linkage was inferred from branch naming because `gh pr view 354`
   failed (no accessible PR object). Treat such inferences as assumptions, not facts, and surface
   them as reviewer risks.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Concluded artifact "never built" from `git ls-files` on current branch only | On branch `90-170-171-auto-impl`, `git ls-files \| grep -iE 'requirements\|sync_req'` returned nothing, so the v1.0.0 plan concluded `sync_requirements.py` / `requirements.txt` never landed and recommended re-scoping/closing #556 | Branch-scoped check missed the files, which exist on the sibling unmerged branch `origin/354-auto-impl`; "never built" was a wrong, branch-scoped claim that flipped the entire disposition | Scan `origin/main` AND all remote branches (`git ls-tree -r <ref> \| grep`, looped over `git branch -r`) before concluding an artifact is missing — issues are often the CI-wiring tail of a sibling issue's unmerged branch |
| Asserted the CI job should be pixi-free (copied `check_dep_sync.py`'s pattern) | The first plan said the new check should run in a stdlib-only / pixi-free CI job, mirroring the repo's existing `check_dep_sync.py` (`tomllib` only) | `sync_requirements.py` calls `subprocess.run(["pixi","list","--json"])`, so it REQUIRES pixi in CI; the "stdlib checks run before pixi" heuristic does not generalize across two superficially similar scripts | Read the check script's `subprocess`/`import`/external-tool calls before deciding its CI env (pixi/node/etc.); same-repo drift checkers can have OPPOSITE runtime needs |
| Recommended re-scoping/closing the issue, deferring to human ratification | v1.0.0's central decision was "recommend re-scoping or closing #556," surfaced as a human-ratify judgment call | Plan reviewer NOGO'd: a discretionary sign-off blocks the next stage from auto-proceeding | Reduce the decision to a deterministic runnable check (`git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/354-auto-impl origin/main` → false = blocked) instead of a recommendation requiring human judgment |
| Gated the plan on a sibling PR merging (deterministic merge-base check) | R1 plan: "wire in `sync_requirements.py` + `requirements.txt`, but only after #354 merges," with `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/354-auto-impl origin/main` as the gate | Reviewer graded it A on quality but NOGO'd: "correct but blocked on external merge" is not actionable today, even at A-grade. The deterministic gate did NOT rescue it — it just evaluates to "blocked," so the next stage still can't proceed today | Make the PR self-contained: regenerate the prerequisite from sources already on your branch (e.g. generate `requirements.txt` from this branch's own `pixi.lock` via `pixi list --json`) instead of stacking/waiting. Removing the dependency, not a better gate, is the fix |
| Vendored a frozen `_RUNTIME_DEPS` allowlist from another branch verbatim | Planned to copy #354's `sync_requirements.py` as-is, including its hardcoded `_RUNTIME_DEPS` set, into the current branch | The frozen set was already stale vs the current branch's `pyproject.toml` (missing `starlette` and `urllib3`, the latter pinned for CVE-2026-44431/44432); transcribing it would silently drop two runtime deps and re-create the drift the check exists to prevent | Derive the set from the source of truth (`pyproject.toml [project.dependencies]`); never freeze a mirror of dynamic data — a frozen mirror is latent drift by construction |
| Trusted the "follow-up from #354" lineage via branch naming | Treated #556 ↔ #354 deliverables and the #354 ↔ `354-auto-impl` link as fact from naming convention | `gh pr view 354` failed (no accessible PR object); the linkage was inferred, never confirmed against the PR API | Fetch linked/parent issues/PRs from the source of truth; when the API call fails, flag the inferred linkage as a reviewer risk rather than a verified fact |
| Assumed merge order without enforcing it | The plan assumes #354 merges BEFORE #556, since #556's new CI job references files that only exist post-#354 | The dependency is stated but not enforced; if merge order is reversed, the new `docker-deps` job references nonexistent files and fails | State the ordering as a deterministic gate AND note that the plan itself does not enforce merge order — call it out as the plan's main residual risk |

## Results & Parameters

### Repo-wide existence scan (the correction)

```bash
# WRONG (v1.0.0): current branch only -> empty -> "never landed" (false conclusion)
git ls-files | grep -iE 'requirements|sync_req'        # (empty on 90-170-171-auto-impl)

# RIGHT (v2.0.0): scan main + every remote branch
git ls-tree -r origin/main --name-only | grep -iE 'requirements|sync_req'   # check main
for b in $(git branch -r --format='%(refname:short)' | grep -v HEAD); do
  git ls-tree -r --name-only "$b" 2>/dev/null | grep -q sync_requirements \
    && echo "FOUND in $b"
done
# -> FOUND in origin/354-auto-impl   (BUILT, not yet merged to main)
```

### Deterministic disposition gate (the merge-order FACT — but NOT the disposition)

```bash
# Is the prerequisite branch already in main? false (BLOCKED) => #556 valid but cannot land yet.
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/354-auto-impl origin/main && echo MERGED || echo BLOCKED
# NOTE: a plan whose disposition is "wait until this returns MERGED" is STILL a NOGO
# ("correct but blocked on an external merge"). The gate is a true fact, not a green light.
```

### Self-contained PR (the R2 fix — remove the external-merge dependency)

```bash
# Instead of depending on #354's sync_requirements.py + requirements.txt, regenerate the
# prerequisite from sources ALREADY on the current branch, so the PR stands alone vs main:
pixi list --json    # confirmed locally on THIS branch's pixi.lock -> 96 pkgs
#   -> generate requirements.txt from this output; commit it in THIS PR.
# And when vendoring sync_requirements.py, FIX its latent bug instead of transcribing:
#   #354's frozen _RUNTIME_DEPS set was stale (missing starlette + urllib3-for-CVE) vs
#   pyproject.toml -> derive the runtime set live from pyproject.toml [project.dependencies].
# Only stack/wait if the prereq genuinely can't be reproduced (needs secrets/infra you lack).
```

### Script-specific CI runtime deps (the second correction)

```bash
git show origin/354-auto-impl:scripts/sync_requirements.py | grep -nE 'subprocess|pixi'
# -> subprocess.run(["pixi","list","--json"])   ==> CI job needs pixi (NOT pixi-free)
# contrast — same repo, OPPOSITE need:
git show origin/main:scripts/check_dep_sync.py  | grep -nE 'import|subprocess'
# -> tomllib only, no subprocess                ==> pixi-free job is correct for THIS one
```

### Most uncertain assumptions (honest reviewer risks)

- **`pixi list --json` may require a prior `pixi install --locked` on CI.** Confirmed to run
  locally (96 pkgs), but whether the CI pixi environment needs `pixi install --locked` first is
  STILL deferred to the first CI run (a fallback is specified, but unproven in CI specifically).
- **The generated `requirements.txt` pin versions are not hand-verified line by line.** Only
  fastapi/starlette/urllib3 were confirmed via `pixi list`; the rest were shown as `<lock>`
  placeholders. The plan is "generate it, commit verbatim," not a hand-checked file.
- **Switching the Dockerfile to `COPY requirements.txt` + `pip install -r requirements.txt` is a
  real behavior change to the production image build.** The `docker build` verification step
  exercises it locally in the plan, but the plan was NOT actually run end-to-end — verification
  commands are proposed, not executed. Verification level = unverified.
- **The Dockerfile change drops the editable self-package (`hermes`) from the build path
  implicitly.** The prior inline extraction also excluded it, and `src/hermes/` is `COPY`'d
  separately, so this is BELIEVED equivalent — but the equivalence was reasoned, not tested.
- **#354 ↔ branch linkage is inferred.** `gh pr view 354` failed (no accessible PR object); the
  #354 ↔ `354-auto-impl` link was inferred from branch naming convention, not confirmed via the
  PR API. (Note: R2's self-contained design no longer DEPENDS on #354 merging — the linkage now
  matters only for attribution, not for the plan's correctness.)
- **`tests/unit/` directory layout assumed to exist.** Not directly confirmed in this round.

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ProjectHermes | Issue #556 ("Add check-reqs to CI to catch requirements drift") — THREE re-plan rounds after successive plan-reviewer NOGOs, on branch `90-170-171-auto-impl` | Unverified. v1.0.0 concluded the assumed `sync_requirements.py` + `requirements.txt` "never landed" (branch-scoped `git ls-files`) and recommended closing the issue — WRONG. A scan of all remote branches found both on `origin/354-auto-impl` (v2.0.0 correction: issue is VALID). R1 then planned to wire them in gated on #354 merging; graded A but NOGO'd ("correct but blocked on an external merge → not actionable today"). R2 (v2.1.0) made the PR self-contained: generated `requirements.txt` from THIS branch's own `pixi.lock` (`pixi list --json` → 96 pkgs confirmed locally) and vendored a CORRECTED `sync_requirements.py` (deriving the runtime set from `pyproject.toml` instead of #354's stale frozen `_RUNTIME_DEPS` that omitted `starlette`/`urllib3`). `sync_requirements.py` calls `pixi list --json` so its CI job needs pixi (unlike stdlib-only `check_dep_sync.py`). `gh pr view 354` failed; branch linkage inferred. |
