# Planning: Defer-Tracking via an Append-Only ADR (Not a Closeable Issue)

When documentation marks work as "planned" / "future phase" / "not yet
implemented" and a reviewer flags it as having no tracker, the instinct is to
open a GitHub issue. Don't. In a repo that already treats ADRs as append-only
and canonical, a new ADR is the durable tracker; a GitHub issue is a fragile
artifact that gets auto-closed and goes stale — which is the exact failure the
finding warns against.

> **Honest scope:** This skill is validated by static doc checks (grep/ls) only.
> The plan that produced it was **not yet implemented or merged** when this skill
> was written. Treat the implementation/CI step as unverified-in-CI.

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-20 |
| **Objective** | Turn an untracked "planned" architecture-doc state into a durably tracked one when a reviewer flags it (Odysseus issue #209, a NITPICK audit finding under epic #174). |
| **Outcome** | Plan written that creates a new append-only ADR (ADR-009) as the canonical tracker and repoints all three `architecture.md` mentions at it. **NOT yet implemented/merged** at time of writing. |
| **Verification** | verified-local — only static `grep`/`ls` verification commands; no CI run, no merge yet. |

## When to Use

- A reviewer or audit flags documented "planned" / "future phase" / "not yet
  implemented" work as having **no tracking issue or ADR**.
- You're tempted to open a GitHub issue to track a deferral, but issues get
  **auto-closed and go stale** — the exact failure mode the finding warns about.
- You need a **durable, canonical tracker** for an architectural-state decision
  in a repo that already uses **append-only ADRs**.
- An existing **inline doc reference points at a CLOSED or wrong-scope issue**
  and must be replaced with a live tracker.
- You're planning a **docs-only change to a read-mostly meta-repo** and must
  respect ADR append-only conventions (new ADR, never edit an accepted one).

## Verified Workflow

> Validated by static doc checks (grep/ls) only. The plan was not yet implemented
> or merged when this skill was written — treat the implementation step as
> unverified-in-CI.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Is the inline tracker reference actually live? (the trap: it may be CLOSED/wrong-scope)
gh issue view <N> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json state,title

# Find every "planned/future phase" mention that needs a tracker
grep -n -iE "planned|future phase|not yet implemented" docs/architecture.md

# Next sequential ADR number
ls docs/adr/

# After edits: confirm no mention still points at the stale closed issue
grep -n "<OldIssueRef>" docs/architecture.md   # expect zero
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Verify the cited tracker's live state before trusting it.** Run
   `gh issue view <N> --json state,title`. Do not assume an inline reference is
   live just because a prior commit added it — it may be CLOSED or scoped to the
   wrong thing (docs vs implementation). An inline link is documentation, not
   proof of tracking.

2. **Choose ADR over issue when the state is long-lived and the repo treats ADRs
   as append-only/canonical.** A GitHub issue is closeable and goes stale; an
   append-only ADR is the durable home for an architectural-state decision. The
   finding typically accepts *either* an issue or an ADR — pick the one that
   survives.

3. **Write the ADR from `docs/adr/template.md` with the next sequential number.**
   Use `ls docs/adr/` to find the next number. Set `Status: Accepted` for a state
   that is *already true* (not a new proposal) — but see the Results section: this
   is a judgment call a reviewer may push back on.

4. **Repoint ALL mentions, not just the one a prior fix touched.** A prior partial
   fix often updates only the prose line that had a link and leaves the
   component-table rows still saying "planned" with no tracker. `grep` every
   occurrence (tables AND prose) and repoint each at the new ADR.

5. **Update the ADR README decision-log/index table** with the new ADR row so the
   index reflects on-disk reality.

6. **Verify with `grep`/`ls` per acceptance criterion.** Confirm zero remaining
   references to the stale closed issue and that every "planned" mention now
   points at the ADR.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Track the deferral with a new GitHub issue | Open an issue to satisfy "no tracking issue" | Issues get auto-closed and go stale — the EXACT failure mode the finding warns about; prior trackers Myrmidons#5 and Odysseus#115 were already CLOSED | Use an append-only ADR for long-lived architectural-state deferrals in repos that have ADRs |
| Trust the existing inline reference at `architecture.md:193` as "already tracked" | A prior commit (d1a3df5/#115) added a `Myrmidons#5` link, looked done | `gh issue view 5` showed state=CLOSED and title was "Document Nomad integration STRATEGY" (docs, not impl) — wrong scope AND closed | Always verify a cited tracker's live state and scope with `gh` before assuming the doc is current |
| Fix only the prose mention that had the link | Repoint just line 193 | The two component-table rows (lines 36, 39) still said "planned" with NO tracker — the finding's gap persisted | `grep` ALL occurrences; a partial prior fix often leaves sibling mentions untracked |
| Amend the `architecture-github-labels-as-state-vocabulary` skill | Same "durable state primitive beats fragile artifact" insight | Different mechanism (labels vs ADR) and different search surface — a searcher for "track a deferred architecture item" wouldn't find it under a labels skill | One skill per independent learning when search keywords diverge |

## Results & Parameters

The heart of this skill is honesty about what was and was not verified. The plan
that produced this skill carries the following uncertain assumptions and
unverified sources — surface these to any reviewer:

- **UNCERTAIN ASSUMPTION:** ADR-009 is the correct next number — assumes no
  concurrent ADR PR claims 009; verified only at plan time via `ls docs/adr/`.
- **UNCERTAIN ASSUMPTION:** Status "Accepted" (not "Proposed") is appropriate —
  the README says set Proposed until merged/accepted by the team; a reviewer may
  require "Proposed". Note ADR-007 and ADR-008 are currently "Proposed", so
  "Accepted" on a brand-new ADR is a judgment call the reviewer may reject.
- **UNVERIFIED EXTERNAL:** `just lint` recipe may not exist (the plan hedges with
  `2>/dev/null || echo`); the repo's actual markdown-lint mechanism (markdownlint
  config per commit 2059078) and its 80-char reflow rule were not directly run —
  ADR prose wrapping is unverified.
- **UNVERIFIED:** exact current line numbers (36, 39, 191–193) are from a
  plan-time `grep` snapshot and may drift before implementation.
- **UNVERIFIED:** that linking `architecture.md` to an ADR (rather than reopening a
  tracking issue) actually satisfies the reviewer's intent in #209 ("No GitHub
  issue or ADR tracks this work" — the finding accepts EITHER, so an ADR should
  suffice, but this is an interpretation).
- **RISK FOR REVIEWER:** the ADR claims specific technical preconditions for
  multi-host work (multi-node cluster beyond `bootstrap_expect=1`, Myrmidons→Nomad
  job-submission path, host-fleet placement) that were inferred from
  `configs/nomad` and ADR-003, not confirmed with the Myrmidons maintainers —
  could be inaccurate.

### Acceptance-criterion verification commands

```bash
# 1. Cited tracker is genuinely live (not the trap)
gh issue view 5 --repo HomericIntelligence/Myrmidons --json state,title

# 2. Every deferral mention now points at the ADR, none left "planned" untracked
grep -n -iE "planned|future phase|not yet implemented" docs/architecture.md

# 3. The stale closed-issue reference is fully gone
grep -n "Myrmidons#5" docs/architecture.md   # expect zero

# 4. The new ADR exists and is indexed
ls docs/adr/ && grep -n "ADR-009" docs/adr/README.md
```

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Odysseus | Issue #209 (NITPICK §3, part of audit epic #174) | Plan to add ADR-009 + repoint `architecture.md`; verification via `grep`/`ls`. |
