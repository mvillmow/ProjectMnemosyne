# C++ cpp-httplib Global In-Flight Request Cap: Planning Assumptions Skill

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Date | 2026-06-19 |
| Objective | Capture the durable, load-bearing assumptions a planner must verify before a global in-flight request cap (acquire in pre-routing / release in post-routing, backed by `std::counting_semaphore`, rejecting with 503) for a cpp-httplib server is safe to build |
| Outcome | Implementation plan produced (planning artifact only — no code written, built, or run) |
| Verification | unverified |
| Context | ProjectAgamemnon issue #273 — add a global in-flight request cap to the cpp-httplib HTTP server, rejecting over-cap requests with 503 |

> **Warning:** This workflow has not been validated end-to-end. Treat as a hypothesis until CI confirms. The plan was never built or run; every assumption below was asserted from convention/memory and NOT verified against source or docs during planning.

## When to Use

1. Planning request throttling, backpressure, or a global in-flight concurrency cap for a cpp-httplib or other embedded HTTP server.
2. Reviewing such a plan — use the assumptions below as the reviewer checklist (assumption #1, post-routing semantics, is the #1 focus).
3. Any design that acquires a resource slot in one callback and releases it in another (split acquire/release across unrelated scopes), especially where a hand-maintained "logical complement" guard decides whether to release.

## Verified Workflow

> **Warning:** This workflow has not been validated end-to-end. Treat as a hypothesis until CI confirms. The section is titled "Verified Workflow" only because the repository validator (`scripts/validate_plugins.py`) requires that literal heading; the `verification: unverified` frontmatter is authoritative — this is a planning artifact and the plan was never built or run.

The core design under review: acquire a semaphore slot in the cpp-httplib pre-routing handler (after auth + rate-limit), release it in the post-routing handler; reject over-cap requests with `503 + Retry-After: 1`; cap is env-configurable (`MAX_INFLIGHT_REQUESTS`, default 64, `0` = disabled). Before treating this design as safe, a planner MUST verify the following load-bearing assumptions — none were verified during planning.

### Quick Reference

Verification commands / actions a planner MUST run before implementation:

```bash
# 1. LINCHPIN: confirm post-routing fires EXACTLY ONCE for every request whose
#    pre-routing returned Unhandled — including read-timeout, client disconnect,
#    write-timeout, and set_payload_max_length (413) rejection. If it does NOT,
#    the semaphore leaks a slot permanently => capacity erodes to zero => self-DoS.
#    Read the PINNED cpp-httplib version's source, not docs/memory:
grep -nE 'routing\(|process_request|post_routing_handler_|set_payload_max_length|content_length' \
  third_party/cpp-httplib/httplib.h   # adjust path to the pinned vendored copy
#    Trace where the post handler is invoked RELATIVE to payload-length checks and
#    timeout/disconnect early-returns. Confirm 413 path (which may fire BEFORE
#    pre-routing at the transport layer) still releases or never acquired.

# 2. Confirm std::counting_semaphore is actually available in the toolchain
#    (C++20 <semaphore> — libstdc++ >= 11 / libc++ >= 13). "Project says C++20"
#    is NOT sufficient evidence the header/feature is present.
echo '#include <semaphore>
int main(){ std::counting_semaphore<1<<20> s{64}; return s.try_acquire()?0:1; }' \
  | ${CXX:-c++} -std=c++20 -x c++ - -o /tmp/sem_check && /tmp/sem_check; echo "exit=$?"

# 3. Load-test the DEFAULT cap before trusting it. 64 and the memory/1MB heuristic
#    are cross-domain guesses; a 1 MB body can parse to several MB of nlohmann::json,
#    so worst-case residency >> 1 MB/req. Measure real per-request peak RSS.
#    (no canned command — drive the load test against a built binary)

# 4. Re-grep cited line numbers instead of trusting the plan. They were read once
#    and may have drifted.
grep -nE 'set_pre_routing_handler|set_post_routing_handler|register_routes' src/routes.cpp
grep -nE 'MAX_INFLIGHT|getenv|server\.' src/server_main.cpp
```

What was SOUND in the plan (kept for balance — do not relitigate these):

- Reuse the existing raw-pointer-by-value capture convention (limiter owned by `main()`, captured by pointer) rather than inventing a new lifetime model.
- Reject (503) instead of blocking on the fixed-size HTTP thread pool — blocking would deadlock the very threads being protected.
- Make the cap optional (`0` = disabled) so existing tests and the shared fixture are unaffected.
- Acquire the slot LAST (after auth + rate-limit) so cheap rejections do not consume capacity.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blocking acquire on the HTTP thread pool | Considered `acquire()` (blocking) so over-cap requests wait for a slot instead of being rejected | cpp-httplib serves requests on a fixed-size thread pool; a blocked thread is one of the threads being protected. Enough blocked waiters deadlock the pool — no thread can ever release. | Use non-blocking `try_acquire()` and reject (503) over-cap; never block on the pool you are protecting. |
| Split acquire/release across pre/post callbacks without verifying post-routing fires on every exit path | Plan acquires in pre-routing, releases in post-routing, guarded by a hand-written `release iff (!exempt && !rejected)` "logical complement" | Asserted (NOT verified) that `set_post_routing_handler` fires exactly once for every Unhandled request including read-timeout, client disconnect, write-timeout, and 413 (`set_payload_max_length`, possibly fired pre-routing at transport layer). If it skips any path, the slot leaks permanently — capacity erodes to zero, a self-inflicted DoS worse than the original bug. | Post-routing-fires-on-every-exit-path is the linchpin; verify against the pinned cpp-httplib source before building. Prefer a single-scope RAII alternative (wrapper around each handler, or a per-request "slot held" flag the post handler reads) over a hand-maintained split invariant that silently breaks when a new exempt path or early-return status is added. |
| Trusting cited line numbers without re-grep | Plan cited exact locations (`src/routes.cpp:216-239`, `src/server_main.cpp:104-111`, etc.) | Lines were read once during planning and drift as the file changes; a reviewer trusting them edits the wrong place. | Re-grep for the symbol/anchor (`set_pre_routing_handler`, `register_routes`) at implementation time; treat cited line numbers as stale hints. |
| Copying the cap heuristic from a different domain | Picked default `64` via `max_inflight ≈ memory_budget / 1MB`, a heuristic lifted from a Python/Scylla context | Real worst-case residency depends on body buffering + JSON parse expansion (1 MB body → several MB of `nlohmann::json`), so 64 may be optimistic and OOM under load. | The default is UNVALIDATED — load-test it. Making it env-configurable was correct, but call out that the default number itself is a guess until measured. |

## Results & Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Env var | `MAX_INFLIGHT_REQUESTS` | Default `64`; `0` = disabled (cap off, tests/fixtures unaffected). Default is an UNVALIDATED cross-domain guess — load-test before trusting. |
| Semaphore type | `std::counting_semaphore<1<<20>` | `kMaxSlots = 1<<20` is the compile-time `LeastMaxValue` (an assumption about acceptable internal sizing). `try_acquire()` is non-blocking by spec (good). Confirm `<semaphore>` is available in the actual toolchain (libstdc++/libc++ version), not merely that the project targets C++20. |
| Over-cap response | `503 Service Unavailable` + `Retry-After: 1` | Reject, do not block — blocking on the fixed HTTP thread pool would deadlock it. |
| Acquire point | Last, after auth + rate-limit | Cheap rejections must not consume a slot. |
| Throttling key (inherited) | `req.remote_addr` (existing per-IP RateLimiter) | UNVERIFIED behind Tailscale / proxy / NAT: if traffic is proxied, all clients collapse to one key. Not changed by this plan, but an inherited risk worth a verification note. |

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
