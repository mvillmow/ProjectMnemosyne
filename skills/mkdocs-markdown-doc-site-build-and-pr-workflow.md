## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Skill** | mkdocs-markdown-doc-site-build-and-pr-workflow |
| **Category** | documentation |
| **Objective** | Build and ship a documentation site (MkDocs + markdownlint) cleanly, and run documentation-only PR workflows without churn |
| **Trigger** | mkdocs/markdownlint CI red; doc deletions; doc/config metric drift; any docs-only PR |
| **Outcome** | Passing `mkdocs build --strict`, green markdownlint, drift gate wired, no-op-aware doc PR flow |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |

## When to Use

- **mkdocs nav/build cleanup** — a PR is about to (or did) delete `.md` files referenced
  by `mkdocs.yml` nav or by surviving docs; CI "Deploy Documentation" fails with
  "Documentation file 'X.md' specified in nav is not found".
- **mkdocs `--strict` out-of-tree links** — a relative link like `../../docs/dev/foo.md`
  or `../../scripts/foo.sh` resolves outside the `docs/` root and `--strict` aborts.
- **markdownlint CI failures** — MD056/table-column-count from `|` inside backtick code
  spans; MD060 compact (unspaced) table separators; MD012/no-multiple-blanks from a
  trailing `\n\n` at EOF; MD040/MD031 from a language-tagged closing code fence;
  MD013/MD032/MD022 line-length/blank-line rules; MD033/MD018/MD059 false-positives in
  prose. Note local pre-commit and the CI `markdownlint` job can diverge (different
  config) — only `markdownlint-cli2` run the way CI does is authoritative.
- **Systemic queue block** — every open PR fails the same required markdownlint check on
  the same `file:line` because the bad row lives in `main`.
- **Doc/config metric drift** — numeric thresholds or config paths documented in
  CLAUDE.md / README.md must stay in sync with authoritative `pyproject.toml` values
  (coverage `fail_under`, `--cov` path, test counts).
- **Documentation-only PR workflows** — detect already-done work, confirm a no-op review,
  triage a docs-only security review, make a small targeted edit, merge overlapping docs,
  or document a pre-commit hook incompatibility in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# --- Pre-deletion audit (run BEFORE pushing any doc-deletion PR) ---
FILES_TO_DELETE=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D origin/main...HEAD -- '*.md')
PATTERN=$(echo "$FILES_TO_DELETE" | xargs -n1 basename | sed 's/\.md$//' | paste -sd'|')
grep -rn -E "$PATTERN" docs/ mkdocs.yml --exclude-dir=.git   # any hit MUST be fixed

# --- mkdocs strict local test ---
pixi run mkdocs build --strict     # must finish with NO WARNING lines

# --- MD056 pipe escape: every | inside backticks in a table cell -> \| ---
# Before: | `pip list | grep x` |     After: | `pip list \| grep x` |
grep -nE '\|.*`[^`]*\|[^`]*`' <file>   # detect backtick spans with internal pipes

# --- Validate markdownlint (file or all) ---
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 "skills/<name>.md"        # "Summary: 0 error(s)"
SKIP=mojo-format pixi run pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --all-files

# --- Doc/config drift gate ---
pixi run python scripts/check_doc_config_consistency.py --verbose

# --- Documentation-only PR orientation (run first) ---
git log --oneline -5; git status; gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)"

# --- Commit on GLIBC-incompatible host ---
SKIP=mojo-format git commit -m "docs(<scope>): <summary>"
```

### Detailed Steps

#### 1 — MkDocs nav cleanup (pre-deletion audit, preferred)

`mkdocs --strict` only catches broken links at build time and stops on the first batch,
so a deletion PR with cross-references in N surviving docs takes N red CI runs to fix
incrementally. Audit up front instead:

1. **Enumerate the deletion set** — every `.md` the PR removes:
   `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D origin/main...HEAD -- '*.md'`.
2. **Build a basename grep pattern** — basenames catch relative links, absolute links,
   nav entries, AND bare prose mentions (e.g. inventory enumerations):
   `echo "$FILES_TO_DELETE" | xargs -n1 basename | sed 's/\.md$//' | paste -sd'|'`.
3. **Grep surviving docs + mkdocs.yml**: `grep -rn -E "$PATTERN" docs/ mkdocs.yml`.
4. **Fix every hit in the same commit**: surviving doc link → remove/repoint;
   `mkdocs.yml` nav entry → remove (and parent section if empty); inventory enumeration
   (`ADR-001 through ADR-XYZ`) → update the range; unavoidable reference → repoint to an
   archive URL/footnote, never leave a bare broken link.
5. **Re-run the grep — must return empty** before committing. Optionally double-check with
   `mkdocs build --strict` if available locally.

**Post-hoc fallback** (CI already red): identify deleted files from the PR diff, run the
same basename audit in ONE pass (do not push partial fixes), remove nav entries + repoint
cross-links, re-grep to empty, `pre-commit run --files ...`, commit and push.

#### 2 — MkDocs `--strict` out-of-tree links

`--strict` rejects ANY relative link whose resolved target leaves `docs/`, regardless of
`../` depth.

```markdown
<!-- WRONG: from docs/adr/ADR-014.md this escapes docs/ -->
[link](../../docs/dev/mojo-jit-crash-workaround.md)
<!-- CORRECT: ../ from docs/adr/ stays inside docs/ -->
[link](../dev/mojo-jit-crash-workaround.md)

<!-- For targets OUTSIDE docs/ (repo root, scripts/, .github/) use an absolute URL -->
See [wrapper](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/blob/main/scripts/mojo-under-gdb.sh).
```

Decision rule for links from `docs/`: target inside `docs/` → relative link (count `../`
carefully); target outside `docs/` → absolute GitHub blob URL; external site → absolute
`https://`. Re-verify with `pixi run mkdocs build --strict` (only WARNING-level entries
abort; INFO is tolerated).

#### 3 — markdownlint build fixes

**MD056 (pipe escape).** `Actual - Expected` equals the count of literal `|` inside
backticks on that row. The reported `line:col` points at the surplus pipe. If it sits
inside backticks, escape each `|` as `\|` (CommonMark renders `\|` back to `|`); if not,
the table itself is structurally wrong — restructure, do not escape. Same fix for any
content: shell pipelines, jq filters (`[.comments[]\|select(.body\|test(...))]`), GHA
expressions (`${{ a && '1' \|\| '0' }}`), CLI syntax (`{dry-run\|smoke\|full}`), regex
alternations. Apply to BOTH the `.md` and any `.history` snapshot — `.history` is linted
by CI and inherits unescaped pipes from absorbed Failed Attempts tables. Do NOT use
`&#124;` inside backticks (renders verbatim) and do NOT change table arity.

**MD060 (table-column-style).** "Table pipe is missing space to the right/left for style
'compact'" fires on separator rows like `|---|---|---|`. The fix is space-padding around
pipes, not dash count — compact `|---|` → spaced `| --- |` (no autofix; `--fix` reports 0
modifications). Bulk-fix every separator row safely with a regex anchored to separator
rows only (never touches data rows, preserves `:---`/`:---:`/`---:` alignment markers):

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path
p = Path("docs/dev/<file>.md")
text = p.read_text()
def fix_sep(m):
    cells = m.group(0).strip().strip('|').split('|')
    return '| ' + ' | '.join(c.strip() for c in cells) + ' |'
p.write_text(re.sub(r'^\|[\s:|-]+\|\s*$', fix_sep, text, flags=re.MULTILINE))
```

**MD012 (no-multiple-blanks) at EOF.** When the reported line `N` is close to the file's
last content line and the visible content there is fine, the real cause is a trailing
`\n\n` at end-of-file — the MD012 line number marks where the blank run *begins*, which at
EOF is the last newline-after-content. Detect (last two bytes both `\n`) and fix in one
pass, then verify with the same tool CI uses:

```bash
[ -z "$(tail -c 2 <file> | head -c 1 | tr -d '\n')" ] && echo "TRAILING_BLANK_AT_EOF"
printf '%s\n' "$(cat <file>)" > <file>.tmp && mv <file>.tmp <file>   # strips ALL trailing blanks, re-adds one
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 <file>                                    # CI parity (cli2 0.22.1 / markdownlint 0.40.0)
```

MD012 default `code_blocks: false` exempts blanks inside fenced code — do NOT strip `\n\n`
inside `` ``` `` fences chasing this (it damages example output and the real violation is
at EOF). The short idiom `sed -i '${/^$/d}'` deletes only one trailing blank (and BSD sed
needs `-i ''`); the `printf` form is portable and strips runs of length 3+. If the same
EOF pattern recurs across 2+ PRs, install `end-of-file-fixer` (see Results & Parameters).

**MD040 / MD031 (closing code fence).** A closing fence must be a bare `` ``` `` — a
language tag like `` ```text `` on a *closing* fence is invalid (only opening fences take a
language) and markdownlint treats it as opening a new block (MD040, MD031, often spurious
MD013 on following lines). Distinguish closing from opening by context: a closing fence
immediately follows content lines; an opening fence follows a blank line or heading. Fix
each occurrence individually with minimal unique context (do NOT `replace_all` `` ```text ``
→ `` ``` `` — it clobbers legitimate `` ```text `` openers used for ASCII diagrams). When a
fence sits below box-drawing characters, anchor the Edit on the 1-2 plain lines before the
fence, not the box-drawing glyphs (their width/encoding differs between Read and the Edit
matcher).

**MD013 (line-length, 120) / MD032 (blanks-around-lists).** Wrap over-length bullets by
continuing on the next line with a 2-space continuation indent; wrap prose at a natural
clause boundary. MD032: add a blank line between a bold lead-in (e.g. `**Breakdown:**`) and
the first list item that follows it.

**Stale count reconciliation (agent-hierarchy docs).** When doc review flags counts that
diverge from reality (e.g. "13 specialists" now 5), never trust the plan/review doc —
`grep -r "^level:" .claude/agents/*.md` the source files, count per level (exclude
templates), and remember orchestrators are not specialists (e.g. `code-review-orchestrator`
is Level 2, not a Level 3 review specialist). Update every dependent surface: diagram box
counts, Level Summaries text, the count table total, and the breakdown list.

**False-positive escape catalog** (escape the character, never reword):

- MD033 on `<placeholder>` in prose → backtick-wrap: `` `<version>` `` (not `&lt;...&gt;`).
- MD018 on line-start `#NNN` → reflow so `#NNN` is mid-sentence, or escape `\#NNN`.
- MD059 on `[link]`/`[here]`/`[click]` → use the real subject: `[PR #5453](url)`.
- MD040 on a fenced block with no language → add a language to the *opening* fence
  (`` ```bash ``/`` ```python ``); MD031 → ensure a blank line before AND after the fence.

**Systemic queue block.** When the same `file:line` fails across unrelated PRs, the bug
is in `main`. Verify uniform failure mode per PR via `statusCheckRollup` before any bulk
action, then run a two-track recovery: Track A lands the escape fix (admin-merge it — its
merge-base still has the bad file, so it will also fail, expected); Track B drains the
stuck queue by admin-merging each verified-uniform PR **sequentially** (parallel
admin-merges race on the base branch).

#### 4 — Doc/config drift detection script

Add a pre-commit gate that reads authoritative values from `pyproject.toml` and asserts
docs match. Place `scripts/check_doc_config_consistency.py` (full source in `.history`)
with checks: coverage `fail_under` vs. `CLAUDE.md` `(\d+)%\+?\s+test coverage`; `--cov=`
path vs. `README.md`; and README test-count claims within a 10% tolerance of
`pytest --collect-only -q`. `main()` returns `int` (the `__main__` block does
`sys.exit(main())`), making unit tests call `main()` directly and assert the return value.
Patch `subprocess.run` in the script's own namespace
(`scripts.check_doc_config_consistency.subprocess.run`), not the stdlib location. Wire it:

```yaml
- id: check-doc-config-consistency
  name: Check Doc/Config Metric Consistency
  entry: pixi run python scripts/check_doc_config_consistency.py
  language: system
  files: ^(CLAUDE\.md|README\.md|pyproject\.toml)$
  pass_filenames: false
```

#### 5 — Documentation-only PR workflow

**Always run orientation first** — `git log --oneline -5`, `git status`,
`gh pr list --head <branch>` — before touching any file.

- **Already-committed detection:** clean status + log commit matching the issue title →
  read target files to confirm content (do not trust the commit message), confirm the
  open PR has auto-merge + `Closes #<N>`, then stop. Do not create a duplicate
  commit/PR. Judge completeness against Success Criteria, not plan notes.
- **No-op review confirmation:** if `.claude-review-fix-*.md` says "no fixes required",
  verify the CI failures pre-exist on `main`, confirm a clean tree, and report — do not
  create an empty commit or redundant push.
- **Docs-only security triage:** classify every changed file; if all are `.md` / static
  `.json` / `.txt` / `.rst` there is no attack surface — issue the clean no-findings
  report. YAML/Actions examples inside `.md` code blocks are documentation, not workflows.
- **Small doc edit:** read the issue + target file, anchor the Edit's `old_string` to the
  lines before AND after the insert point, `pre-commit run --all-files`, commit only the
  modified file with `Closes #<N>`, push, `gh pr merge --auto --rebase`.
- **Merge overlapping docs:** read both in parallel, grep all cross-references
  (`grep -rn "old-filename\.md" --include="*.md" .`), append unique content into the
  canonical, `git rm` the duplicate, repoint every reference (including self-referential
  "See Also" links in the canonical), then fix MD013/MD032 and close fenced blocks with a
  plain ```` ``` ```` (never ```` ```text ```` as a closing tag).
- **Hook incompatibility doc:** audit `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `docs/dev/`, and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` first (often only CONTRIBUTING.md is missing); add a `####` subsection
  with OS/library range, exact warning text, what the hook does automatically, the CI
  guarantee, and a link to the full compat doc.

**GLIBC caveat:** if `mojo-format` fails with `GLIBC_2.3x not found` and no `.mojo` files
changed, `SKIP=mojo-format git commit ...`. All other hooks must pass. Prefer
`pixi run pre-commit run --all-files` over `just pre-commit-all` (the latter fails with
unrelated "Text file busy" errors).

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Push deletion PR with no upfront cross-reference audit | Scorched-earth deletion PR; mkdocs `--strict` failed on surviving docs linking to a deleted page | mkdocs reports broken links only at build time and stops on the first batch; partial fixes guarantee another red iteration per missed referrer | Run the basename pre-deletion audit grep in the same commit as the deletion; after ANY deletion-caused CI failure, re-audit the full deletion set before re-pushing — never patch only the file CI named |
| Rely on mkdocs to catch stale inventory enumerations | A surviving `docs/README.md` enumerated `ADR-001 through ADR-008` including deleted ADRs | `--strict` validates only parsable link targets, not bare filename/ID mentions in prose | Use a basename grep (not just link-target grep) so prose mentions, footnotes, and inventory lists are caught too |
| Treating link-check failures as in-scope | Planned to fix root-relative path errors in unrelated files in a deletion PR | They were pre-existing on `main`, not caused by the PR | Verify with `gh run list --branch main --workflow "..."` before scoping fixes |
| Adding more `../` hops / HTML anchor / symlink for out-of-tree links | Bumped `../../` to `../../../`, used `<a href=...>`, symlinked `docs/scripts -> ../scripts` | `--strict` rejects ANY relative link resolving outside `docs/`, parses HTML anchors the same way, and renders symlinked non-doc files as broken pages | Link to non-doc files via absolute GitHub blob URLs |
| Wrapped pipe content in HTML code tags / used `&#124;` inside backticks | Tried `<code>...</code>` or HTML entity to protect pipes in a table cell | markdownlint counts unescaped `\|` before any code-span/HTML semantics; backticks render `&#124;` verbatim | Backslash-escape each internal pipe as `\|`; use `&#124;` only outside backticks |
| Ran `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` for MD056 | Hoped autofix would handle the table-column error | MD056 has no autofix — 0 modifications, error persists | Manual `\|` escape; triage by `line:col` (column lands on the surplus pipe) |
| Adding columns to the header / removing the pipe to absorb MD056 | Bumped header arity or rewrote the command without the pipe | Destroyed table semantics or lost the documented behavior | Never change table arity; escape the pipe and preserve the example verbatim |
| HTML-entity / bracket-removal for MD033, reword to `[here]` for MD059, leading space for MD018 | Tried `&lt;version&gt;`, dropped angle brackets, `[here]`, indented `#NNN` | Entities render literally; brackets carry substitution-slot meaning; `here`/`click`/`this` are also non-descriptive; the ATX parser strips leading whitespace | Backtick-wrap placeholders, use the real subject as link text, reflow or `\#NNN` |
| Parallel admin-merge of a stuck markdownlint queue | Ran `gh pr merge --admin` against 17 PRs concurrently | 13 hit "base branch was modified" races | Admin-merge stuck queues sequentially, one at a time, after a per-PR `statusCheckRollup` audit |
| Trusted `.history` snapshots to be lint-safe | Snapshotted skill files into `.history` without pre-flight lint | Absorbed Failed Attempts tables carry unescaped pipes; `.history` IS linted by CI | Pre-flight markdownlint on BOTH the `.md` AND `.history` before pushing |
| Patched `subprocess.run` globally in drift-check tests | `patch("subprocess.run", ...)` for `collect_actual_test_count` | The script already imported `subprocess`; patching the stdlib location has no effect on the bound reference | Patch in the module's own namespace: `scripts.check_doc_config_consistency.subprocess.run` |
| Used `pytest.raises(SystemExit)` for drift-check `main()` tests | Expected `main()` to call `sys.exit()` | `main()` returns `int`; only the `__main__` block exits | Call `main()` directly and assert the return value |
| Creating an empty commit / duplicate PR on a no-op or already-done branch | Committed review files or re-edited targets "to have something"; ran `gh pr create` without checking | Adds history noise / opens a second PR causing CI confusion | Only commit real changes; always check `gh pr list --head <branch>` and read target files first |
| Performing full multi-phase security review on a docs-only PR | Ran Phase 1-3 review on a PR of only `.md` + `plugin.json` | All findings excluded by the hard docs exclusion rule; YAML inside `.md` code blocks is documentation, not a workflow | Classify file types first; if all docs/metadata, issue the no-findings report immediately |
| Closing fenced blocks with ```` ```text ```` after a doc merge / pasting long lines | Used a language-tagged closing fence; pasted 150-241 char source lines | markdownlint treats ```` ```text ```` as opening a new block; lines failed MD013 | Close fences with a plain ```` ``` ````; run markdownlint after every merge to catch line length and MD032 |
| Running `just pre-commit-all` / `pixi run npx markdownlint-cli2` for validation | Used `just` or `npx` as the validation entrypoint | `just`/`npx` not on PATH on this host; `just` also throws unrelated "Text file busy" | Use `pixi run pre-commit run --all-files` (or `markdownlint-cli2 --all-files`) directly |
| Editing the main repo instead of the active worktree | Made CLAUDE.md edits in the main repo path | The worktree tracks a different commit on the feature branch | Edit the worktree directly or `cp` changes into the worktree path |
| Trusted the local pre-commit `Markdown Lint` hook for MD060 | `pre-commit run` printed `Passed`; pushed; CI's separate `markdownlint` job failed MD060 on the same file | Pre-commit and CI use different markdownlint configs — the hook did not enforce MD060 on compact separators | Pre-commit passing does NOT imply CI passes; run `markdownlint-cli2 <file>` directly (the way CI does) before pushing |
| `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` for MD060 | Expected autofix to space the separators like other rules | MD060/table-column-style has no autofix; 0 modifications, error persists | Apply the separator regex (or hand-edit); do not spend a cycle on `--fix` |
| Added more dashes to compact separators | Tried `\|------\|------\|` thinking MD060 wanted longer dashes | MD060 is about space-padding around pipes, not dash count | Space-pad pipes (`\| --- \|`); dash count is irrelevant |
| Edited the literal "line N" the MD012 error named | Opened the file at the reported line looking for visible double blanks | None there — the line was real content; the blank run actually started at EOF | The MD012 line number marks where the run *begins*; when `N ≈ file length`, check the last two bytes for the EOF case first |
| Body-scanned for `\n{3,}` to find MD012 double-blanks | `grep -P` / `rg -U` for triple newlines | Misses EOF: there the sequence is `\n\n<EOF>` (two newlines), not three | EOF is special — use a tail-2-bytes check, not a body-scan regex |
| Stripped blank lines inside fenced code to fix MD012 | Saw `\n\n` inside `` ``` `` example blocks and deleted them | MD012 `code_blocks: false` exempts fenced code; the real violation was at EOF — damaged example output for zero benefit | MD012 ignores fenced blanks; restrict the visual scan to outside fences before suspecting in-fence blanks |
| `sed -i '${/^$/d}'` to clear the trailing blank | Used the canonical one-trailing-blank sed idiom | Deletes only a single trailing blank (leaves runs ≥3); BSD/macOS sed also needs `-i ''` | Use `printf '%s\n' "$(cat file)" > file` — portable, strips all trailing blanks in one pass |
| `replace_all` on `` ```text `` → `` ``` `` to fix all closing fences | Bulk-replaced every language-tagged fence | Also clobbers legitimate `` ```text `` *opening* fences used for ASCII diagrams | Fix each closing fence individually using surrounding context to distinguish from openers |
| Trusted a plan/review doc's stated agent count | Used "10 impl + 5 review" from the plan without checking source | Plan was stale; actual files showed 11 + 4, and the orchestrator was miscounted as Level 3 | Always `grep "^level:" .claude/agents/*.md` the source files; orchestrators (Level 2) are not Level 3 specialists |
