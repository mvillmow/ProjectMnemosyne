# GitHub Auto-Merge: CI Gating, Branch Protection, and Merge Method

## Overview

| Date | Objective | Outcome |
| ------ | ----------- | --------- |
| 2026-06-07 | Consolidated canonical for why GitHub auto-merge does not fire and how to arm it correctly: wrong merge method, missing/required CI status contexts, two-layer branch protection, GPG-signing blockers, ruleset bootstrap deadlock, the `state:implementation-go` arming-state machine, and advisory-vs-required gate split | Each failure mode has a verified diagnosis + fix; verified across many HomericIntelligence repos in live CI |

GitHub auto-merge is **stricter than branch protection** and fires only when EVERY check (required and non-required) reaches a clean terminal state, the chosen merge method is allowed, every required status context has actually posted, all commits are verified-signed, and BOTH protection layers (ruleset + classic) are satisfied. A PR that looks ready (`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`/`MERGEABLE`) can sit forever when any one of those is silently unmet. This skill covers the merge-blocking mechanics; it does NOT cover general CI failure diagnosis, rebase-conflict resolution, review-loop orchestration, or PR enumeration.

**Verification: verified-ci** (most failure modes observed and fixed live; the advisory-split and per-issue arming refinements are verified-local where noted).

## When to Use

- A PR is `CLEAN`/`MERGEABLE` with auto-merge armed but never merges (after minutes to hours).
- `gh pr merge --auto --rebase`/`--squash` errors or silently fails to arm on a squash-only repo.
- A PR is `BLOCKED` because a required status context never posts: workflow never triggered, a `paths:` filter excluded the PR, or the required-check NAME does not match the emitted job name.
- GPG-signing failures or mismatched committer emails leave commits unsigned and block the `pr-policy` gate (or the ruleset's `required_signatures`).
- A ruleset and classic branch protection disagree; their UNION blocks merge.
- A PR introducing a NEW workflow is permanently BLOCKED because the ruleset requires check names that only exist in the workflow being added (bootstrap deadlock).
- An advisory/timing-sensitive sub-check should report but not block, yet currently gates merge because it lives in the required `pr-policy` gate.
- Deciding which merge method a repo supports before arming auto-merge; auditing required-check names after adding/removing CI jobs.
- `pr-policy` fails on premature auto-merge: `Auto-merge is enabled before implementation review GO` (or the inverse, label present but auto-merge off).
- A post-CI `/learn` (or any capture step) fires on the optimistic point (auto-merge armed) instead of the truth (detected merge), polluting downstream state.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. WHY isn't auto-merge firing? Full state snapshot.
gh pr view <PR> --json number,mergeStateStatus,mergeable,autoMergeRequest,statusCheckRollup

# 2. Zero CI runs on the branch => auto-merge will NEVER fire (no check event ever posts)
gh run list --branch "$(gh pr view <PR> --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)"   # [] = stalled

# 3. Which merge method does the TARGET repo allow? (detect, do not hardcode)
gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO> --jq '{rebase:.allow_rebase_merge, squash:.allow_squash_merge, merge:.allow_merge_commit}'

# 4. Arm with the correct flag, then verify it actually armed
gh pr merge <PR> --auto --squash         # squash-only repos REJECT/ignore --rebase
gh pr view <PR> --json autoMergeRequest --jq '.autoMergeRequest.mergeMethod'   # expect SQUASH

# 5. What does branch protection ACTUALLY require? (check BOTH layers)
gh api repos/<O>/<R>/branches/main/protection --jq .required_status_checks.contexts  # classic (may 404)
gh api repos/<O>/<R>/rulesets/<RID> --jq '.rules[]|select(.type=="required_status_checks")|.parameters.required_status_checks[].context'

# 6. Unresolved bot review threads block merge with all checks green (required_review_thread_resolution)
gh api graphql -f query='{repository(owner:"O",name:"R"){pullRequest(number:N){reviewThreads(first:50){nodes{isResolved}}}}}' \
  --jq '[.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]|select(.isResolved==false)]|length'

# 7. pr-policy "Auto-merge enabled before GO": un-arm, rerun, let the label workflow arm it
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed | grep '::error::'
gh pr merge <PR> --disable-auto && gh run rerun <run-id> --failed

# 8. Bulk batch: list ALL open PRs (default limit is 30 — silently omits older PRs)
gh pr list -R <O>/<R> --state open --limit 200 --json number,mergeStateStatus,autoMergeRequest
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Squash-only merge-method detection

Some repos set `allow_rebase_merge: false` (the HomericIntelligence default — `{"rebase":false,"squash":true,"merge":false}`). The wrong method hides in THREE places: docs/CLAUDE.md, code (`pr.merge(merge_method="rebase")`), and skill/plugin instruction files (`/learn`, `/finish-branch`). Symptoms differ by form: the CLI `gh pr merge --auto --rebase` **silently fails to arm** (no error), while a PyGithub/API call **fails loudly** with `GraphQL: Rebase merges are not allowed on this repository (mergePullRequest)` / `(enablePullRequestAutoMerge)`.

The robust fix is **settings-aware selection**, not swapping one hardcoded flag for another (that just breaks on a rebase-only or merge-only target). Detect and pick by preference order `rebase` (linear history) -> `squash` -> `merge`:

```bash
choose_merge_flag() {
  gh api "repos/$1" --jq '[
    (if .allow_rebase_merge then "--rebase" else empty end),
    (if .allow_squash_merge then "--squash" else empty end),
    (if .allow_merge_commit then "--merge"  else empty end)
  ] | .[0] // ""'
}
MERGE_FLAG=$(choose_merge_flag "HomericIntelligence/ProjectMnemosyne")   # -> --squash here
gh pr merge "$PR" --auto "$MERGE_FLAG" --repo HomericIntelligence/ProjectMnemosyne
```

Audit for the bug in all forms, and add a source-inspection unit test as a durable guard:

```bash
grep -rn 'merge_method="rebase"\|--auto --rebase\|gh pr merge.*--rebase' .
```

```python
import inspect
from hephaestus.github import pr_merge
def test_pr_merge_uses_squash_not_rebase():
    src = inspect.getsource(pr_merge)
    assert 'merge_method="rebase"' not in src and 'merge_method="squash"' in src
```

#### Required-check name management

GitHub uses `jobs.<id>.name:` (falling back to the job id) as the status-check CONTEXT string; the ruleset's `required_status_checks.context` must match EXACTLY. Use the bare job name (`lint`, `build`, `unit-tests`) — NOT the workflow-prefixed form `"Required Checks / lint"`. A slash is valid in `name:` but not in a job id, so `name: security/dependency-scan` is the correct way to emit a slashed context.

Required-check membership lives in repo settings / ruleset, OUTSIDE the workflow file. Always include `"integration_id": 15368` (the GitHub Actions app id) in `required_status_checks`, or the contexts never match a run. Audit alignment between what is required and what is emitted:

```bash
gh api repos/<O>/<R>/branches/main/protection --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts[]' | sort > /tmp/required.txt
grep -rh "name:" .github/workflows/*.yml | sed 's/.*name: //' | sort -u > /tmp/emitted.txt
comm -23 /tmp/required.txt /tmp/emitted.txt   # required but NOT emitted => blocks every PR
```

When a required context never posts because the workflow did not trigger: a path-filtered `on: pull_request` workflow sees zero changed files; **force-push after rebase** (`git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main && git push --force-with-lease`) re-evaluates path filters against the new tip SHA. Do NOT use empty `--allow-empty` commits (no path diff), `workflow_dispatch` (does NOT satisfy required checks), or close+reopen (unreliable). The ONE exception: a dropped downstream `workflow_run` gate (real tests green, gates stuck `pending:0`, zero runs created) is recovered by a single empty **signed** `chore:` commit — that re-evaluates trigger scheduling. (Note these are inverse fixes — diagnose which event was dropped first.)

A PR that touches only paths excluded by every workflow's `paths:` filter (`pods/**`, `**/*.md`, `scripts/**`, `justfile`) generates ZERO check events; auto-merge then waits forever even with no required checks. Fix per-PR with a manual merge, or permanently by broadening `paths:`.

#### Two-layer branch protection (ruleset + classic)

HomericIntelligence `main` protection is split across TWO layers and GitHub enforces their UNION (stricter wins). A rule reported as `0`/absent in the ruleset can still be enforced by classic protection, and vice-versa — so always audit BOTH.

- **RULESET = shared baseline** (identical across repos): `deletion, non_fast_forward, pull_request (required_approving_review_count=0), required_linear_history, required_signatures, required_status_checks`. Canonical contexts: `lint, unit-tests, integration-tests, security/dependency-scan, security/secrets-scan, build, schema-validation, deps/version-sync`.
- **CLASSIC = repo-specific ADDITIONS only**: `required_conversation_resolution: true` (all repos) plus each repo's EXTRA contexts not already in the ruleset. NO reviews, NO linear-history in classic.

Critical gotchas:
- `required_conversation_resolution` is **classic-only**; putting `{"type":"required_conversation_resolution"}` in a ruleset PUT returns `HTTP 422: data matches no possible input`. (`required_linear_history`/`non_fast_forward` ARE valid ruleset types.)
- A ruleset PUT is a **full replace** of `.rules` — fetch, dedup the same type, append, then PUT the full object. Never PUT only the new rule.
- `GET branches/main/protection` on an unprotected repo returns a 404 BODY `{"message":"Branch not protected","status":"404"}`. Guard `.status=="404"` before extracting contexts, or its top-level keys (`documentation_url`/`message`/`status`) become FAKE required contexts that permanently block merges.
- All-checks-green + `MERGEABLE` can still sit `BLOCKED` on `required_review_thread_resolution: true` — unresolved `@github-advanced-security` (CodeQL) review threads gate merge. Detect via the GraphQL `reviewThreads` query (REST field is empty); READ each `path:line` and classify false-positive vs genuine, document accept-rationale, then `resolveReviewThread`. A force-push amend re-runs CodeQL and can post NEW threads — re-check the count after amending.
- A `branch-protection-drift` required check that fails in ~4s with empty `--log-failed` is failing at the `gh api` call itself: `Resource not accessible by integration (HTTP 403)` from hitting the admin `branches/main/protection` endpoint with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Switch to `rules/branches/main` (readable with `contents: read`; field names differ — `dismiss_stale_reviews` -> `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push`). Fixing the 403 EXPOSES real drift — survey the ecosystem (count:0, dismiss:false, thread-resolution:true) to decide which side is authoritative.

#### GPG-signing as a blocker

The ruleset's `required_signatures` silently blocks unsigned commits, and a `pr-policy` gate often re-checks signatures via GraphQL `verified: true`. Mismatched committer emails or a missing `-S` produce unsigned commits that block merge with no obvious failing test. `git log --show-signature` showing `U` (good signature, untrusted local key) is FINE — GitHub verifies against the REGISTERED key. Always sign with `-S`; an empty re-trigger commit must also be signed or it is rejected by the same gate it is trying to unblock.

#### Ruleset bootstrap deadlock

A PR adding a new CI workflow can be permanently `BLOCKED` with `failing_count=0` because the ruleset requires check names that exist ONLY in the workflow being added — and GitHub runs workflows from the BASE branch, so the new workflow never runs against its own PR. Signature: `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED` + `failing_count=0` + workflow absent from `main`.

```bash
gh pr view $PR --repo $REPO --json mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup \
  --jq '{status:.mergeStateStatus, failing_count:([.statusCheckRollup[]|select(.conclusion!="SUCCESS" and .conclusion!="SKIPPED" and .conclusion!=null)]|length)}'
```

Resolve via: Option 1 admin "Merge without waiting for requirements" (fastest); Option 2 temporarily REMOVE the entire `required_status_checks` rule entry from `rules[]` (NOT `[]` — that returns HTTP 422 "Expected at least 1 elements, got 0"), merge, then restore; Option 3 a transitional PR that adds the workflow alongside the old aggregate check first.

#### Advisory-vs-required gate split

A timing-sensitive sub-check bundled into a REQUIRED gate (e.g. the auto-merge ↔ `state:implementation-go` state machine inside `pr-policy`) blocks correct PRs. The fix is to SPLIT it into its own job (e.g. `auto-merge-policy`) whose name is NOT in the ruleset — making it advisory (reports red as a signal, never blocks). The new job needs its OWN `gh pr view --json autoMergeRequest,labels,state` fetch and the SAME triggers (re-run on `auto_merge_enabled`/`auto_merge_disabled`/`labeled`/`unlabeled`, no `needs:`); trim the parent's fetch to `--json body`. Required-check membership lives in the ruleset, OUTSIDE the YAML — a new job is non-required BY DEFAULT until an operator adds its name. Update any text-based workflow tests that asserted the old bundled fetch string.

#### Arming-state machine (`state:implementation-go` + detected-merge)

Two distinct state machines gate arming:

1. **pr-policy label gate (#899).** The label and auto-merge state must MATCH: (`state:implementation-go` + auto-merge ON) or (no GO label + auto-merge OFF). Any mismatch fails `pr-policy` Check 2. Distinguish the error strings — `Auto-merge is not enabled on this PR` is the OLD propagation race (enable fast / rely on the `auto_merge_enabled` self-heal); `Auto-merge is enabled before implementation review GO` is the NEW gate where re-running alone does nothing. Fix by aligning the label (`gh pr edit <PR> --add-label state:implementation-go`, which re-runs `pr-policy` green with no new commit) OR disabling premature auto-merge (`gh pr merge <PR> --disable-auto`). Automate the GO transition with a `pull_request_target` `labeled` workflow that does NOT checkout PR code, re-fetches server-side metadata, validates a numeric `PR_NUMBER`, and arms `--auto --squash`. A workflow added by a PR is not active on `main` until that PR merges, so validate it on a follow-up PR. Guard `pr-policy` for terminal state: after merge GitHub clears `autoMergeRequest`, so fetch PR `state` and exit 0 for non-`OPEN` PRs.

2. **Capture on detected-merge, per-issue (#844).** Post-CI `/learn` (or any capture step) must fire on the TRUTH (`gh pr view --json mergedAt` confirms MERGED), not the optimistic point (`_enable_auto_merge` returned True) — otherwise captures pollute from PRs that armed but never shipped. Replace the optimistic call with a per-issue arming record (`state_dir/drive-green-armed-<issue>.json`: `pr_number`, `pr_head_branch`, `head_sha_at_arming`, `armed_at`, `learn_captured_at`). Fan out one record per sibling via the shared-PR dedupe map (`shared_pr_issues = {pr: [issues]}`) so a 9-issue shared PR yields 9 captures. Resolve at drive-start:

   | GH state | `learn_captured_at` | Head SHA | Action |
   |----------|--------------------|--------|--------|
   | any | not null | any | success, no capture (already done) |
   | MERGED | null | any | fire capture once, set `learn_captured_at` (always, even on failure), success |
   | OPEN | null | same | success, no capture (still in flight) |
   | OPEN | null | different | drop record, re-enter drive (force-pushed) |
   | CLOSED (not merged) | null | any | drop record, re-enter drive (abandoned) |

   Set `learn_captured_at` even on capture FAILURE (gating it on success loops forever). Fall back to `repo_root` for cwd when the post-merge worktree is gone.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Waited for auto-merge to fire on CLEAN PRs with zero CI | Left CLEAN+armed PRs for 9+ hours | Auto-merge needs at least one check EVENT; zero CI runs (path-excluded PR) means it never fires | `CLEAN` + `statusCheckRollup: []` is the stall signal; manual-merge or broaden `paths:` |
| Assumed no required checks => immediate merge | Verified protection had no required checks | GitHub still waits for a check event signal | Auto-merge != "merge when CLEAN" |
| `gh pr merge --auto --rebase` on a squash-only repo | Followed stale CLAUDE.md / hardcoded `--rebase` | `allow_rebase_merge: false` — CLI silently fails to arm; API fails loudly with GraphQL "Rebase merges are not allowed" | Detect allowed methods via `gh api repos/<repo>`; pick rebase->squash->merge; guard with a source-inspection test |
| Swapped a hardcoded `--rebase` for a hardcoded `--squash` | Reactive one-flag fix | Still wrong on a rebase-only/merge-only target | Settings-aware `choose_merge_flag`, not a new hardcode |
| `gh pr list` without `--limit` | Listed open PRs to arm a backlog | Default limit is 30 — 31+ open PRs silently omit the older ones | Always `--limit 200` when sweeping a backlog |
| Ran `gh pr create` then `gh pr merge --auto` sequentially | Two sequential commands | `pr-policy` read `autoMergeRequest` ~4s later, before enablement propagated → `Auto-merge is not enabled` | Enable fast; add the `auto_merge_enabled` trigger so the gate self-heals; else re-run after the run completes |
| Edited the PR body to add `Closes #N` expecting a re-run | Edited body, waited | `pull_request` does not fire on `edited` | Re-run the failed job; body edits never re-trigger |
| Treated `cancelled` sibling jobs as real failures | Counted every non-success rollup entry | One `pr-policy` race failure tore down the run via the `concurrency` group, cancelling all siblings; a green re-run superseded them | Filter by `conclusion=="FAILURE"` AND `startedAt` later than open+60s; cross-check `state` (may be MERGED); never force-merge to escape |
| Ran `--auto --squash` right after create on a #899 repo | Old habit | `pr-policy` Check 2 fails `Auto-merge is enabled before implementation review GO` | Match the label to the auto-merge state; add `state:implementation-go` OR `--disable-auto` |
| Added `{"type":"required_conversation_resolution"}` to a ruleset | PUT it into `rules[]` | `HTTP 422: data matches no possible input` — it is classic-only | Keep convo-resolution in classic; `required_linear_history`/`non_fast_forward` ARE valid ruleset types |
| PUT a ruleset with only the new rule in `{"rules":[...]}` | Partial PUT | Ruleset PUT is a FULL REPLACE — drops the entire baseline | Fetch, dedup same type, append, PUT the full object |
| Parsed `branches/main/protection` on an unprotected repo | Treated the 404 body as data | Top-level keys became fake contexts (`message`/`status`) that block all merges if PUT back | Guard `.status=="404"` before extracting contexts |
| Assumed ruleset `required_approving_review_count=0` meant no review gate | Ignored the classic layer | Classic independently required 1 review, blocking ~18 signed PRs | Audit BOTH layers; the union wins |
| Read `--log-failed` for a 4s `branch-protection-drift` failure | Assumed transient | It was `HTTP 403 Resource not accessible by integration` at the admin endpoint | Read the full `--log`; switch to `rules/branches/main`; fixing the 403 exposes real drift |
| Set `required_status_checks` to `[]` to unblock a bootstrap deadlock | Empty array PUT | `HTTP 422: Expected at least 1 elements, got 0` | Remove the entire rule ENTRY from `rules[]`, not patch it to `[]` |
| Re-triggered CI for a PR adding a new workflow | `gh workflow run` / push triggers | GitHub runs workflows from the BASE branch; the new workflow is absent on `main` | Bootstrap deadlock: admin-bypass, remove-rule-merge-restore, or a transitional PR |
| Kept the timing-sensitive auto-merge check inside required `pr-policy` | Operator workaround (disable-auto, rerun) | The check depends on a label-triggered workflow; a correct PR still failed and BLOCKED | Split orchestration/timing concerns into a non-required advisory job (name out of the ruleset) |
| Fired `/learn` on `_enable_auto_merge` returning True | Captured at the optimistic point | PRs arm then get blocked/cancelled; captures from PRs that never shipped pollute state | Capture only on detected-merge; use a per-issue arming record resolved by `gh pr view --json state,mergedAt` |
| One capture per PR for shared-PR groups | Dedupe collapsed N issues to 1 worker | Each issue is a distinct lesson; 8 siblings got none | Fan out via `shared_pr_issues` map: dedupe at the worker layer, fan out at the lesson layer |
| Pushed an unsigned empty commit to re-trigger CI | `git commit --allow-empty` without `-S` | The same `pr-policy`/`required_signatures` gate blocks unsigned commits | Sign re-trigger commits with `-S`; `U` (untrusted local key) is fine, GitHub verifies the registered key |
| `workflow_dispatch` to satisfy required checks | `gh workflow run <wf> --ref <branch>` | Dispatch runs do NOT satisfy branch-protection required contexts | CI must be triggered by `pull_request`; force-push after rebase to re-fire path filters |
| Trusted `mergeStateStatus` right after force-push | Checked immediately | It lags several minutes — shows BLOCKED while CI is passing | Verify via `actions/runs?branch=<branch>` matching `head_sha` |
