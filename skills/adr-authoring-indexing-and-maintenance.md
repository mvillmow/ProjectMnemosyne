# ADR Authoring, Indexing, and Maintenance

End-to-end skill for the lifecycle of Architecture Decision Records: creating new
ADRs, keeping the `docs/adr/README.md` index table in sync, updating ADR status
through its lifecycle (including `Accepted (Deferred)`), consolidating duplicate
limitation comments into a single ADR with cross-references, and keeping ADR
directory-tree listings accurate against the real filesystem.

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| Date | 2026-06-07 |
| Objective | Author and maintain ADRs and their index, status, cross-references, and embedded directory trees |
| Outcome | Consistent, traceable ADRs; index always reflects on-disk ADRs; status reflects code reality; no duplicate limitation comments |
| Category | documentation |
| Verification | verified-ci (core); v1.3.0 additions (section I) are verified-local, CI pending |

## When to Use

- **Authoring**: Making a significant architectural decision, choosing between technical alternatives, documenting design trade-offs, or recording rationale for future reference.
- **Indexing**: An ADR file exists under `docs/adr/` but its row is absent from the `## ADR Index` table in `docs/adr/README.md`; a quality audit or GitHub issue flags a missing ADR index entry; a new ADR was merged without the author updating the index table.
- **Status lifecycle**: An ADR has `**Status**: Accepted` but the implementation explicitly bypasses the architecture (e.g., `# Temporary: Direct malloc`); a bypass comment references a known platform gap (e.g., Mojo global variable support); the underlying design decision is still valid but the active status is wrong.
- **Consolidation**: A GitHub issue says "consider a single shared ADR instead of cross-referencing between two function docstrings"; two or more functions contain nearly identical `# NOTE:`/`Note:` blocks describing the same limitation; an audit finds that updating a limitation note requires editing multiple files.
- **Directory-tree accuracy**: A file is deleted/added in a PR but the ADR directory tree was not updated; a follow-up issue asks to verify a helpers/tests directory is accurately documented; `grep` finds an ADR tree listing fewer files than `ls` shows on disk.
- **Cross-repo citation discipline**: Writing an ADR in a meta-repo (e.g., Odysseus) that references decisions from submodule repos or external docs; the ADR text asserts an ADR number from another repo; the ADR claims a CLAUDE.md or internal doc says something — all such claims must be verified on disk before the ADR is written since ADRs are append-only once Accepted.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

| Task | Key command / action |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| Create ADR | `docs/adr/ADR-NNN-<slug>.md`; fill Context/Decision/Rationale/Consequences/Alternatives; Status `Proposed` → `Accepted` |
| Add index row | Edit `docs/adr/README.md`; insert row `[ADR-NNN](ADR-NNN-<slug>.md) \| Title \| Status \| YYYY-MM-DD` (ascending order) |
| Defer status | Edit with `replace_all: true`: `**Status**: Accepted` → `**Status**: Accepted (Deferred)` (header + Document Metadata) |
| Consolidate dupes | Create ADR, replace each verbose block with 2–3 line `See docs/adr/ADR-NNN-<name>.md` cross-ref |
| Fix dir tree | Compare ADR ASCII tree vs `ls`; Edit to match real files using `├──`/`└──` connectors |
| Lint | `pixi run pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files docs/adr/<file>.md` (NOT `npx`/`just`) |
| Cross-repo ADR ref | `ls docs/adr/` to verify number exists; cite commit SHA for cross-repo work; cite `<file>:<line>` for CLAUDE.md claims |
| Land | conventional commit `docs(adr): ...`, push, `gh pr create --label documentation`, `gh pr merge --auto --rebase` |

### Detailed Steps

#### A. Generating a new ADR

1. **Identify the decision** — what choice needs documentation.
2. **Research alternatives** — gather evidence and performance data.
3. **Check the next ADR number** with `ls docs/adr/` and read one recent ADR to match its structure.
4. **Create the file** at `docs/adr/ADR-NNN-<slug>.md` using the template below.
5. **Fill sections** — Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences (Positive/Negative/Neutral), Alternatives Considered.
6. **Add the index row** (section B) and set status `Proposed` → `Accepted` after review.

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Title

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: Names/roles

## Context
What is the issue we're facing?

## Decision
What decision are we making?

## Rationale
Why this decision? Key reasons.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Benefit 1

### Negative
- Drawback 1

### Neutral
- Other impact 1

## Alternatives Considered
### Alternative 1
Why not chosen.
```

**Status lifecycle**: `Proposed` (under consideration) → `Accepted` (active) → `Deprecated` (no longer recommended) → `Superseded` (replaced by a newer ADR). `Accepted (Deferred)` is a valid variant — see section C.

#### B. Adding a missing ADR index entry

1. **Read the ADR file** to get the canonical title, status, and date — never guess from the filename:

   ```bash
   head -10 docs/adr/ADR-NNN-<slug>.md
   ```

   Extract the `**Status**:` value, the `**Date**:` value, and the title after the colon in the `# ADR-NNN: ...` heading.

2. **Read the current index** (`cat docs/adr/README.md`) and find the last row of the `## ADR Index` table; the new row goes immediately after it, maintaining ascending ADR-number order.

3. **Edit README.md** using the exact previous last row as `old_string` and append:

   ```markdown
   | [ADR-NNN](ADR-NNN-<slug>.md) | <Title> | <Status> | <Date> |
   ```

   These updates are always exactly one table row — no surrounding context changes are needed.

#### C. Updating status to Accepted (Deferred)

1. **Read the ADR** to confirm it has a status in two places — the header (line ~3) and the Document Metadata section near the tail:

   ```text
   **Status**: Accepted          ← header
   ...
   - **Status**: Accepted        ← Document Metadata section
   ```

2. **Use `replace_all: true`** in the Edit tool to update both occurrences in one operation:

   ```text
   old_string: **Status**: Accepted
   new_string: **Status**: Accepted (Deferred)
   replace_all: true
   ```

3. **Verify both locations** were updated by reading the header and the tail.
4. If the ADR body already documents the bypass (a "Current Limitation" / "Known Limitation" section), only the status label needs changing — no body edits required.

#### D. Consolidating duplicate ADR references

1. **Read the issue and its plan** (`gh issue view <number> --comments`) to confirm scope.
2. **Locate all duplicate comment blocks** before editing — e.g. `Grep pattern="NOTE.*<keyword>" glob="**/*.mojo" output_mode="content"`.
3. **Create the ADR** (section A). Fill an Executive Summary (the limitation + workaround), Context/Key Findings (compiler/runtime facts), Decision (the workaround), Consequences (quantify perf/maintenance impact), Alternatives Considered (include "keep duplicate comments" and explain why rejected), and Supersession Criteria (explicit conditions to mark it Superseded).
4. **Add the index row** (section B).
5. **Edit each source file** — replace the verbose block with a 2–3 line cross-reference, and rewrite any "see sibling function" comments to point directly at the ADR:

   ```mojo
   # <Short description of limitation>; using <workaround>.
   # See docs/adr/ADR-NNN-<name>.md for rationale.
   ```

   For docstring `Note:` blocks, keep the `Note:` label and shorten the body:

   ```text
   Note:
       <Limitation> uses <workaround> (~Xx slower than optimized path).
       See docs/adr/ADR-NNN-<name>.md for full rationale.
   ```

   Update ALL cross-references (including inline body comments that referenced a sibling function) to point at the new ADR — leaving "see sibling_fn()" defeats the purpose.

#### E. Keeping the ADR directory tree accurate

1. **Confirm the actual state** with `gh issue view <number> --comments` and `ls <directory>/`; verify whether a deletion/addition actually happened (it may already be done by a prior PR).
2. **Find the stale reference**: `grep -n "<dir>\|<deleted-file>" docs/adr/ADR-*.md`.
3. **Compare** the ADR listing against `ls` — look for phantom references (listed but gone) and incomplete listings (on disk but missing).
4. **Edit the tree** to match reality, preserving the existing ASCII format (`├──`/`└──` connectors and trailing comments):

   ```text
   └── helpers/
       ├── __init__.mojo                     # Package re-exports
       ├── fixtures.mojo                     # Test fixture utilities
       ├── utils.mojo                        # Tensor debugging utilities
       ├── test_fixtures.mojo                # Self-tests for fixtures.mojo
       └── test_utils.mojo                   # Self-tests for utils.mojo
   ```

#### F. Validate and land (all tasks)

1. **Lint** with pre-commit's markdownlint (works in pixi-managed environments; does NOT require `npx` or `just`):

   ```bash
   pixi run pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files docs/adr/<file>.md
   # or for broader changes
   pixi run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

   Watch for MD013 (120-char line limit) — URLs in list items are NOT exempt; wrap after the closing `)` of the URL. GLIBC-related mojo errors in stderr on older hosts are non-blocking; the relevant hooks still run and pass.

2. **Commit, push, PR, auto-merge**:

   ```bash
   git add docs/adr/<changed-files>
   git commit -m "docs(adr): <summary>

   Closes #<issue-number>"
   git push -u origin <branch>
   gh pr create --title "docs(adr): <summary>" --body "Closes #<issue-number>" --label documentation
   gh pr merge --auto --rebase
   ```

#### G. Pending-PR accuracy on epic branches

When writing an ADR on an **epic branch** that pulls together work from multiple child PRs,
some of those child PRs may not yet be merged to `main`. Use the correct tense for each item:

| Work state | Language to use | Example |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| Already on `main` (merged PR or direct commit) | Past tense — "was split", "now has", "reduced to" | "Split of `any_tensor.mojo` is now ≤3,000 lines (PR #5503 / commit abc1234)." |
| Open child PR, not yet merged | Pending tense — "pending split", "will reach", "once PR #N merges" | "Pending split of `any_tensor.mojo` (4,106 lines) into 6 focused sibling modules (PR #5503 — pending merge to main)." |

**Rule**: Only use completion language for work that is already on `main` at the time the ADR
is written. If a child PR is still open, describe the work as pending/in-flight and include
the PR number so readers can check the merge status themselves.

**Template — pending entry (Remediation section)**:

```markdown
- **#NNNN**: Pending <description>. (<implementation detail>) (PR #XXXX — pending merge to main)
```

**Template — completed entry (Remediation section)**:

```markdown
- **#NNNN**: <Past-tense description>. (PR #XXXX / commit <hash>)
```

**Template — Consequences section, pending work**:

```markdown
- `file.mojo` will reach <target> once PR #XXXX merges, with <benefit>.
```

**Verification**: Before finalising the ADR, run:

```bash
# Confirm which child PRs are actually merged
for pr in <list of PR numbers>; do
  gh pr view "$pr" --json state,mergedAt --jq '"\(.state) mergedAt=\(.mergedAt)"'
done
# merged + mergedAt set → use past tense
# OPEN / mergedAt null  → use pending tense
```

Reviewers will flag any past-tense claim on an epic branch if the underlying PR is still open
(the file on the branch will contradict the claim). Fix before requesting re-review.

#### H. Cross-repo citation discipline in append-only ADRs

ADRs are frozen once Accepted. Any unverifiable claim baked into an Accepted ADR is permanent.
Apply these rules **before drafting** any ADR that references work in other repos or external docs.

**Rule 1 — Verify ADR numbers on disk before asserting they exist.**

```bash
ls docs/adr/
# Only assert "ADR-NNN" if docs/adr/ADR-NNN-*.md appears in this listing.
# If the number came from an implementation plan or external source, treat it as unverified.
```

**Rule 2 — Use commit SHAs for cross-repo work, not asserted ADR numbers.**

When documenting that another repo made a decision, prefer:

```markdown
# GOOD: verifiable evidence
The C++ HMAS hierarchy extraction is verifiable via commits 473da6a/341ae56 in ProjectAgamemnon.

# BAD: unverifiable assertion
ADR-015 subsequently extracted the C++ HMAS hierarchy.
```

If the external ADR number cannot be verified on disk, fall back to "external docs cite ADR-NNN"
framing, paired with the commit SHA or file:line citation that proves the work happened.

**Rule 3 — Cite `<file>:<line>` for CLAUDE.md or internal-doc claims.**

Never write "Keystone's internal documentation refers to this decision as 'ADR-016'" without citing
the exact file and line. Use:

```bash
grep -n 'ADR-016' submodule/CLAUDE.md
# → CLAUDE.md:144, CLAUDE.md:156 — cite these line numbers in the ADR
```

Template for a cross-repo label claim:

```markdown
ProjectKeystone's `CLAUDE.md` (lines 144, 156) labels the Python orchestration layer as ADR-016.
```

**Rule 4 — Frame unverifiable external ADR numbers as "external docs cite X".**

| Situation | Safe framing | Unsafe framing |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| External plan says "ADR-015 did X" but no file exists locally | "External docs cite ADR-015; this is not present in `docs/adr/` (001–009 confirmed on disk)." | "ADR-015 subsequently extracted …" |
| Cross-repo CLAUDE.md mentions a number | "ProjectKeystone `CLAUDE.md:156` labels this layer as ADR-016." | "Keystone's internal documentation refers to this decision as 'ADR-016'." |
| Cross-repo work verified by commit | "The extraction is verifiable via commits 473da6a/341ae56 in ProjectAgamemnon." | "ADR-015 extracted the C++ hierarchy." |

**Verification checklist before finalising a cross-repo ADR**:

```bash
# 1. Confirm every ADR number cited exists on disk
ls docs/adr/   # shows 001-009 → only assert numbers in this range

# 2. Find commit SHAs for cross-repo work
git -C <submodule-path> log --oneline | grep -i '<keyword>'

# 3. Verify CLAUDE.md line numbers
grep -n 'ADR-[0-9]\+\|<keyword>' <submodule-path>/CLAUDE.md
```

#### I. Tracked-symbol anchoring, index membership guard, and the Nygard 4-digit variant (Proposed — verified-local, CI pending)

> The additions in this subsection were captured from ProjectHephaestus issue #1452
> (2026-06-30). The structural guard test was run and passed locally (4 passed;
> `markdownlint-cli2` passed); CI had not yet run when this was recorded. Treat as
> **verified-local** until confirmed in CI.

**Rule 1 — Anchor an ADR that documents code on *tracked* symbols, never on untracked
working-tree files.** Before writing a Decision section that names a code artifact as the
canonical implementation, confirm the file is git-tracked:

```bash
git ls-files hephaestus/agents/invoker.py   # empty output → UNTRACKED → do not cite as canonical
```

In #1452, ADR-0005 originally cited `hephaestus/agents/invoker.py` / `AgentInvoker` as the
canonical artifact, but `git ls-files` returned empty — the file was untracked and
out-of-scope for the PR. If merged, the ADR would document a decision whose primary artifact
does not exist on `main`, a latent staleness/POLA risk. Fix: anchor on **tracked** symbols
(`AgentName = Literal["claude","codex","pi"]` at `hephaestus/agents/runtime.py:23`; `is_codex`
at `runtime.py:205`) and demote the untracked `AgentInvoker` to "illustrative of the direction,
not the canonical anchor."

**Rule 2 — Verify the audit's *characterization* against the live tree, not just its
file:line evidence.** Issue #1452 described a "dual-agent" runtime; reading
`hephaestus/agents/runtime.py:23` showed `Literal["claude","codex","pi"]` — **three** agents.
The ADR documented the true tri-agent reality and explicitly noted the audit's framing was
wrong. The count or description in an audit can be wrong, not merely stale — read the live code
before transcribing the audit's claim into a frozen ADR.

**Rule 3 — Add a bidirectional README↔disk membership-guard test so the ADR index stays
enumerable.** Mirror the `api_table_docs` membership-guard pattern: assert SET EQUALITY between
the ADR files linked in the README index and the ADR files on disk, so a stale link OR a
missing link both fail. In ProjectHephaestus this lives at `tests/unit/docs/test_adr_records.py`
(a sanctioned extra test dir). The full guard asserts: (a) every `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` filename
matches `^\d{4}-[a-z0-9-]+\.md$`; (b) numeric prefixes are contiguous from 1 with no gaps or
dupes; (c) each ADR has the required Nygard sections (`## Context`, `## Decision`,
`## Alternatives considered`, `## Consequences`) plus `- Status:` / `- Date:` and a
`# ADR-NNNN:` title; (d) the README index links **exactly** the set of ADR files on disk.

```python
def test_readme_index_lists_every_adr() -> None:
    readme = (ADR_DIR / "README.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    linked = set(re.findall(r"\(([0-9]{4}-[a-z0-9-]+\.md)\)", readme))
    on_disk = {p.name for p in _adr_files()}  # *.md excluding README.md
    assert linked == on_disk, f"index out of sync: missing={on_disk-linked}, stale={linked-on_disk}"
```

Test the README↔disk SET EQUALITY (`linked == on_disk`), not just one direction — a
one-directional "every ADR file is linked" check passes silently when README links a deleted ADR.

**Rule 4 — Match the repo's local ADR format; ProjectHephaestus uses the Nygard 4-digit
variant.** This skill's default is the `ADR-NNN-<slug>.md` / `**Status**:` format. Hephaestus is
different — document the variant so future ADR work there matches the local convention:

| Aspect | This skill's default | ProjectHephaestus (Nygard 4-digit) |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Filename | `docs/adr/ADR-NNN-<slug>.md` | `docs/adr/NNNN-<kebab>.md` (4-digit zero-padded) |
| Title | `# ADR-NNN: …` | `# ADR-NNNN: …` |
| Metadata | `**Status**: …` / `**Date**: …` | list-style `- Status: Accepted` / `- Date: YYYY-MM-DD` / `- Tracks: #NNNN` |
| Sections | Context / Decision / Rationale / Consequences / Alternatives Considered | `## Context` / `## Decision` / `## Alternatives considered` (lowercase 'c') / `## Consequences` |
| Markdown gate | `pixi run pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files <paths>` | `pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files <paths>` (hook id `markdownlint-cli2`, NOT `markdownlint`) |

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Single Edit without `replace_all` | Edited only the header status field when deferring | ADR has two status locations (header + Document Metadata); only one was updated | Use `replace_all: true` to catch all occurrences in one edit |
| `pixi run npx markdownlint-cli2` | Ran markdownlint via npx | `npx: command not found` even inside the pixi environment | Use `pixi run pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files <file>` — pre-commit has the tool |
| `just pre-commit-all` | Ran `just pre-commit-all` to validate markdown | `just` not available in the worktree shell environment | Use `pixi run pre-commit run ...` instead |
| Long URL list item on one line | Put `[Issue #NNN](https://...): description` on one line | MD013 fired (line > 120 chars) | Wrap after the closing `)` of the URL onto the next line |
| Referencing sibling function in comment | Left "see sibling_fn() for details" instead of pointing to the ADR | Still requires navigating to another function — defeats consolidation | Update ALL cross-references to point directly at the new ADR path |
| Trusting issue-body line numbers | Edited the line number an issue cited for a stale entry | Line number referenced an earlier state of the file | Don't trust line numbers from issue descriptions; grep for the actual pattern |
| Past-tense claim for open child PR | ADR said "#5182: Split of `any_tensor.mojo` is now ≤3,000 lines" | On the epic branch `any_tensor.mojo` was still 4,106 lines because PR #5503 had not merged; reviewer flagged two threads (line 24 and line 55) — factually false | Use pending tense for open PRs: "Pending split … (PR #XXXX — pending merge to main)"; past tense only for work already on main |
| "is now" in Consequences for pending PR | Consequences said "`any_tensor.mojo` is now ≤3,000 lines" when PR #5503 was unmerged | False on the branch; same code review thread flagged it as a second major finding | Write "will reach ≤3,000 lines once PR #XXXX merges" for pending outcomes; "is now" only after the PR lands |
| Assuming the deletion was pending | Searched for an allegedly-stale deleted-file reference | No matches — the file was already removed by a prior PR | Always check both the filesystem AND the ADR independently before editing |
| Asserting cross-repo ADR number without on-disk verification | ADR-009 draft said "ADR-015 subsequently extracted the C++ HMAS hierarchy" | `ls docs/adr/` shows only 001–009; ADR-015 does not exist in Odysseus; reviewer caught permanently-baked false claim in an append-only document | Run `ls docs/adr/` before asserting any ADR number; if the file isn't listed, reframe as "external docs cite ADR-NNN" + commit SHA evidence |
| Asserting CLAUDE.md content without file:line citation | ADR-009 draft said "Keystone's internal documentation refers to this decision as 'ADR-016'" | No file:line was cited; reviewer blocked as unverifiable in a frozen document | Run `grep -n 'ADR-016' submodule/CLAUDE.md` first; cite the exact lines (e.g., `CLAUDE.md:144,156`) in the ADR |
| Trusting implementation plan ADR numbers | Used ADR numbers from a planning doc without verifying on disk | Planning docs can reference ADRs from other repos or future ADRs not yet merged | Always independently verify every ADR number reference with `ls docs/adr/` in the target repo |
| Citing an untracked working-tree file as an ADR's canonical artifact | ADR-0005 named `hephaestus/agents/invoker.py`/`AgentInvoker` as the implemented abstraction | `git ls-files` showed `invoker.py` was untracked; the ADR would reference a symbol absent from `main` | Run `git ls-files <path>` before citing a code artifact in an ADR; anchor on tracked symbols, mark untracked ones illustrative |
| One-directional ADR-index check | Considered asserting only "every ADR file is linked in README" | A stale link to a deleted ADR would pass silently | Assert SET EQUALITY (`linked == on_disk`) so stale AND missing links both fail |
| Trusting the audit's "dual-agent" description | Nearly wrote the ADR for two agents | `runtime.py:23` had `Literal["claude","codex","pi"]` — three | Verify the audit's CHARACTERIZATION against live code, not just its file:line evidence |
