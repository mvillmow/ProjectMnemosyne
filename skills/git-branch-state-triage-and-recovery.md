# Git Branch State Triage and Recovery

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-07 |
| **Objective** | Diagnose what state a branch is in (stale/superseded, orphaned/unrelated history, or diverged from remote) and recover it cleanly |
| **Outcome** | Success — unified triage tree: confirm-and-discard superseded branches, extract+recreate orphan branches, reset+cherry-pick diverged branches |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |

## When to Use

Use this skill whenever a branch is in an unexpected or unmergeable state. The root question
is always: **what state is this branch in, and how do I recover it?** Three distinct states:

**State A — Stale / superseded by main:**
- A branch is many commits behind main **and** its remote tracking ref is gone (`[gone]` in `git branch -vv`)
- The task is "get all open PRs merged" — check `gh pr list --state open` first; if zero open PRs the premise has changed
- A `git diff origin/main...HEAD` shows a large file count difference but you suspect most of it is merge noise
- Staged files with AD status in `git status --short` (added in index, deleted from working dir)
- Hundreds or thousands of HEAD-only files exist vs main, and main has commit messages like "consolidate N skills into X" or "absorb C086" — this is a **corpus consolidation** divergence, not unique unmerged work
- A branch **looks unmerged but is actually subsumed by a squash-merge**: `git cherry origin/main <branch>` shows every commit with a `+` prefix, `git rev-list --count origin/main..<branch>` reports commits "ahead", and an auto-rebase onto main **conflicts** — yet the branch's PR was already squash-merged. Squash gives the merged work a brand-new patch-id, so `git cherry` never matches and these signals are **false positives**. Disambiguate with message-search on main, **not** git cherry / ahead-counts (see "Squash-merge false positive" below). A worktree showing "uncommitted modified files" can be the same false alarm — verify with a 0-unique-lines diff against main

**State B — Orphan / unrelated history:**
- `git merge-base` returns nothing between branch and main
- Error: "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
- Branch appears to have a completely different commit history (suspect: pushed from wrong repo)
- PR shows massive unexpected file changes

**State C — Diverged from remote:**
- `git push` fails with "non-fast-forward" on a feature branch
- `git status` shows "Your branch and 'origin/<branch>' have diverged"
- A fix commit exists locally but the remote has accumulated additional commits (e.g. after a rebase or stacked-PR retarget)
- A fix plan assumed the remote was behind, but it actually has more commits than local

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# === Triage: which state am I in? ===
git branch -vv | grep "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"   # [gone] = remote ref deleted
git merge-base HEAD origin/main || echo "ORPHAN: no common ancestor"  # empty = State B
git status                                                    # "diverged" = State C

# === State A: stale / superseded by main ===
gh pr list --state open                          # check premise FIRST
FORK=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)           # fork point
git ls-tree --name-only -r HEAD skills/ | sort > /tmp/head.txt
git ls-tree --name-only -r origin/main skills/ | sort > /tmp/main.txt
comm -23 /tmp/head.txt /tmp/main.txt              # HEAD-only files (maybe new, maybe old)
git log --diff-filter=D --oneline origin/main -- <path> | head -1  # how main disposed of it
# staged-index no-op check:
git ls-files --stage | awk '{print $1, $4}' | sort > /tmp/staged.txt
git ls-tree -r origin/main | awk '{print $3, $4}' | sort > /tmp/mainh.txt
comm -23 /tmp/staged.txt /tmp/mainh.txt           # staged files NOT on main = true new work

# === State A: squash-merge FALSE POSITIVE — do NOT trust git cherry / ahead-counts ===
# These LIE on squash repos (squash = new patch-id, cherry never matches):
git cherry origin/main <branch>                   # every commit shows '+' even when subsumed
git rev-list --count origin/main..<branch>        # >0 "ahead" even when subsumed
# Reliable disambiguator — message-search on main for the squash commit (PR number / subject):
git log origin/main --oneline | grep -iE '<distinctive phrase or (#PRnum)>'
# found on main  => branch is SUBSUMED: safe to discard, no rebase/PR. Cross-check PR state:
gh pr list --head <branch> --state all --json number,state   # MERGED/CLOSED corroborates
# rebase conflicts on a subsumed branch are EXPECTED (squash content on main collides with the
# original un-squashed commits). Report "subsumed" and STOP — do not resolve, do not auto-delete.

# === State A: worktree "uncommitted modified files" 0-unique-lines redundancy check ===
# A modified working-tree file can be byte-for-byte already on main (it shipped via a merged PR):
diff <(git show origin/main:<path>) <(cat <worktree>/<path>) | grep -c '^>'  # 0 = no unique lines
# 0 unique lines on ALL modified files => the "uncommitted work" already merged; safe to discard.

# === State A (large-scale): three-way count diff for consolidation divergence ===

# === State C: diverged from remote ===

git reset --hard origin/<branch>                  # absorb remote, AFTER confirming fix applies
git cherry-pick <fix-sha>                         # apply only the targeted fix
```

### Detailed Steps

#### State A — Stale-branch-superseded-by-main diagnosis

1. **Check the premise**: run `gh pr list --state open` before any branch archaeology. If
   there are zero open PRs, the task "get all PRs merged" is already done — report and stop.
2. **Find the fork point**: `git merge-base HEAD origin/main` gives the SHA where the branch
   diverged. All analysis is relative to this point.
3. **Three-way file inventory**: compare `git ls-tree` outputs for HEAD and origin/main on
   the relevant directories, piped through `sort` then `comm` → three sets: HEAD-only,
   main-only, both.
4. **For each HEAD-only file**: run `git log --diff-filter=D --oneline origin/main -- <path>`.
   A commit message containing "consolidate", "merge", or "absorb" means main intentionally
   deleted it via a consolidation PR. An empty result means the file genuinely never reached
   main (rare for an old branch).
5. **For each file in both**: compare `version:` frontmatter. If main's version number is
   strictly greater, main has the newer copy and the branch's change is stale.
6. **Staged index check**: if `git status --short` shows many AD-status files (added in index,
   deleted in working tree), hash-compare `git ls-files --stage` against `git ls-tree
   origin/main`. If every staged hash matches a main hash, the staged index is a no-op.
7. **Apply the three-condition test** — a branch is fully superseded when **all three** hold:
   - Its deletions are already absent from main, AND
   - Its modified files have lower version numbers than main's, AND
   - Its "new" files are already present on main.

   When all three hold the branch has zero net contribution and can be discarded.

#### State A (squash-merge) — `git cherry` false positive, message-search disambiguator

On repos where PRs are **squash-merged** (the default on many repos), the commit-level
"is this on main?" tools cannot be trusted:

- `git cherry origin/main <branch>` shows **every** branch commit with a `+` prefix (its
  meaning is "this patch is not on main"), so a fully-merged branch looks entirely unmerged.
- `git rev-list --count origin/main..<branch>` reports the branch is N commits **ahead**.

Both are **false positives**. The reason: squash-merge collapses the branch's commits into a
single brand-new commit on main with a **different patch-id**. `git cherry`'s patch-id
matching never matches the branch's original commits, and the original commits are genuinely
not reachable from main, so the ahead-count is non-zero. **Neither signal means the work is
unmerged.**

The reliable disambiguator is **message-search on main**. Take a distinctive phrase from the
branch's commit subject (or the PR title), and grep main's history:

```bash
git log origin/main --oneline | grep -iE '<distinctive phrase or (#PRnum)>'
```

If the squash commit is found on main, the branch is **subsumed** — safe to discard, no
rebase and no PR required. Cross-check the PR state to corroborate:

```bash
gh pr list --head <branch> --state all --json number,state   # MERGED / CLOSED corroborates
```

Important consequence: when you try to auto-rebase a subsumed branch onto main it will
**conflict**, *precisely because* the same changes already exist on main as a squash commit
and the branch's original un-squashed commits collide with them. **A rebase conflict on a
subsumed branch is expected and is NOT evidence of unmerged work.** Correct action:

- Report "subsumed" and **stop**. Do **not** spawn a conflict-resolution swarm — every
  resolution would be "take main's side" on every file, producing an empty branch with zero
  net benefit.
- Do **not** auto-delete the branch. Branch deletion is left to the user / gh-tidy's own
  y/N prompts (and is Safety-Net-blocked anyway — see below).

**Worktree-redundancy variant.** A worktree reporting "uncommitted modified files" can be the
same false alarm. Diff each working-tree file against `origin/main` and count unique lines:

```bash
diff <(git show origin/main:<path>) <(cat <worktree>/<path>) | grep -c '^>'
```

`0` unique lines on **all** modified files means the "uncommitted work" is byte-for-byte
already on main (it shipped via a merged PR); the worktree is safe to discard. Real example:
worktree `agent-a7fe2df2b7f6e658b` had 3 modified files all showing 0 unique lines vs main —
the `log_on_error` changes had already merged via PR #1372.

**Destructive ops are Safety-Net-blocked — hand them to the user.** Once safety is proven
(subsumed / 0-unique-lines), the *recovery* commands are blocked by the CC Safety Net hook
even with in-conversation user approval; the assistant cannot override the hook and must print
the exact command for the **user** to run manually:

- `git checkout -- <file>` (discards tracked changes) — "use `git stash` first", then hand to user
- `git worktree remove --force <path>` (can discard uncommitted work) — hand to user
- `git tag -d <tag>` (deletes tags) — hand to user
- `git branch -D <branch>` — branch deletion is gh-tidy's job anyway
- `git stash drop` and `rm -rf .worktrees/` are likewise blocked

Workflow shape: **prove** safety (subsumed / 0-unique-lines), **then print** the precise
`--force` / `-d` / `checkout --` command for the user to execute.

#### State A (large-scale) — Three-way count diff for corpus-consolidation divergence

When a branch has **hundreds or thousands** of HEAD-only files vs main AND main shows
consolidation commit messages, spot-checking a few file versions is not sufficient — the
branch and main may have diverged in *opposite* directions simultaneously.

1. **Find the merge-base**: `MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)`. All counts are
   relative to this ancestor.
2. **Count artifacts at all three points**:
   ```bash
   git ls-tree -r --name-only "$MERGE_BASE" skills/ | grep '\.md$' | sort > /tmp/base.txt
   git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD            skills/ | grep '\.md$' | sort > /tmp/branch.txt
   git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main     skills/ | grep '\.md$' | sort > /tmp/main2.txt
   wc -l /tmp/base.txt /tmp/branch.txt /tmp/main2.txt
   ```
   Interpret: if `base→branch` grew (new skills added on branch) but `base→main` shrank
   (consolidation on main), the branch has old originals that main absorbed into canonical
   merged skills. The branch-only files are the **pre-consolidation originals**, not new work.
3. **Compute three comm sets**:
   - `comm -23 branch main` (branch-only): would be deleted by reset — are these old originals or new skills?
   - `comm -13 branch main` (main-only): canonical merged skills the branch is missing.
   - `comm -12 branch main` (intersection): files present in both — compare versions.
4. **Confirm consolidation on main**: `git log --oneline origin/main | grep -iE 'consolidat|absorb|cluster' | head -10`.
   Messages like "consolidate 50-cluster 516->291" confirm main ran systematic consolidation
   after the branch diverged. Branch-only files matching the pre-consolidation count at
   merge-base are the absorbed originals, not unique work.
5. **Safety: stash before any destructive reset**:
   ```bash
   git stash push -u -m "pre-reset snapshot $(date +%Y%m%d)"
   ```
   The stash is a recoverable snapshot. Confirm `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` contains
   only commits superseded by main's consolidation PRs before running `git reset --hard origin/main`.
6. **Surface the finding to the human** when branch-only file count is large (e.g. >500).
   The decision to hard-reset is irreversible without the stash — it's the human's data and
   they should confirm the conclusion explicitly.

#### State B — Orphan-branch recovery (no common ancestor)

1. **Diagnose**: `git fetch origin <branch>` then `git merge-base origin/main
   origin/<branch>`. No output (exit 1) = no common ancestor.
2. **Understand the divergence**: `git log --oneline origin/main..origin/<branch>` (commits
   on branch not in main) and the reverse. Then `git log --oneline origin/<branch> | tail -10`
   — unfamiliar "Initial commit" lines reveal the branch was created from a different repo.
3. **Inspect contents**: `git ls-tree --name-only origin/<branch> | head` — unexpected files
   (e.g. `.mojo-version` in a Python project) confirm a wrong-repo push.
4. **Extract valuable content** before any deletion:
   ```bash
   git show origin/<branch>:plugins/cat/name/SKILL.md > /tmp/SKILL.md
   ```
5. **Check if already merged**: `git log --oneline origin/main -- <path>`. Often the real
   content already landed via a correct PR and the orphan is just a stale duplicate — then no
   recreation is needed, just delete.
6. **Delete and (if needed) recreate**:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete <branch>
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   git checkout -b <branch>
   cp /tmp/extracted <path>/ && git add . && git commit -m "feat: recreated from broken branch"
   git push -u origin <branch>
   ```

   **Root cause / prevention**: orphan branches typically come from running `/learn` (or any
   commit-and-push flow) from one project's working directory while pushing to another's
   remote. Always verify `git remote -v` matches the expected repository before pushing.

#### State C — Diverged-branch cherry-pick fix

1. **Diagnose the divergence**: `git status` shows "diverged, N and M different commits". Run
   both `git log --oneline origin/<branch>..HEAD` (local-only) AND `git log --oneline
   HEAD..origin/<branch>` (remote-only). The remote-only side is the one usually forgotten —
   a fix plan may claim "just push" while the remote has accumulated commits since.
2. **Understand each side**: `git show origin/<branch>:path/to/file` to see the remote's
   current version; `git show <fix-sha> --stat` to see exactly what the local fix touches.
   Confirm the fix applies cleanly on top of the remote tip.
3. **Reset local to remote tip** (only after confirming the fix applies):
   `git reset --hard origin/<branch>`.
4. **Cherry-pick the minimal fix**: `git cherry-pick <fix-sha>`. Resolve any conflicts, then
   `git cherry-pick --continue`. Cherry-pick the targeted fix only — never the full local
   commit stack, which may duplicate an equivalent commit already on the remote.
5. **Verify**: `git status` should show "ahead by 1 commit"; `git show HEAD --stat` confirms
   the fix is present. Then push (fast-forward now succeeds).

   This same pattern recovers stacked-PR fix commits: when a stacked PR is retargeted and
   lint/CI fix commits made after the retarget become orphaned from the prerequisite, reset to
   the correct remote tip and cherry-pick the orphaned fix commits onto it.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Judging staleness by spot-checking a few file `version:` fields | Compared version numbers in ~5 files on branch vs main to determine which side was "newer" | Branch and main had diverged in opposite directions: branch grew (new skills added), main shrank (consolidation). A handful of version comparisons gave a misleading picture of the whole | Run a three-way file-count diff (branch vs main vs merge-base) before drawing any conclusion when hundreds of files are involved |
| Assuming "branch's PR already merged ⇒ all branch work is on main" | Saw that an early PR (#1572) was merged and concluded the branch had no remaining contribution | An early PR merged but the bulk of the branch's subsequent commits (hundreds of new skills added after the merge) never reached main — they were simply abandoned before the branch was last touched | PR-merge history answers only "did this PR's content land?" not "has every commit on this branch landed?" — check `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` for the full picture |
| Committing the large working-tree deletions | Working tree showed hundreds of deleted files; first instinct was to commit them as "cleanup" | The deletions were not intentional cleanup — they were the working tree reflecting pre-consolidation originals that the index still tracked but disk did not have. Committing would have reverted ~360 skills and downgraded canonicals main had since improved | Never commit large file-count deletions without first running the three-way count diff; if `comm -23 branch main` shows thousands of "branch-only" files that map to the pre-consolidation count at merge-base, the deletions are stale state, not new work |
| Treating HEAD-only files as unmerged value | Assumed "file present in HEAD but not in main" = "work not yet on main" | Most HEAD-only files were OLD files that main subsequently deleted or consolidated through later PRs after the branch diverged | Always check HOW a file left main (`--diff-filter=D`) before assuming it was never there |
| Using plain `git log` to find deletions | `git log --oneline origin/main -- <path>` showed nothing | Plain log only shows commits that touched the file; it does not surface the deletion commit reliably | `--diff-filter=D` is required to find the commit that removed a file |
| Treating AD status as uncommitted work | `git status --short` showed hundreds of AD lines and looked like staged changes needing attention | AD status is normal for branches created in worktrees not fully restored to disk — files exist in the index but not on disk | AD means "added in index, deleted from working dir"; verify hashes match main before treating as new work |
| Direct push after local commits (diverged) | Assumed local was ahead of remote and pushed | Branches had diverged; remote had 13 additional commits not present locally | Always check `HEAD..origin/<branch>` not just `origin/<branch>..HEAD` before pushing |
| Treating a fix plan at face value | Plan said "2 commits ahead, just push" | Plan was written before the remote accumulated additional commits | Re-diagnose actual remote state with `git log --oneline HEAD..origin/<branch>` before acting |
| Keeping local commits and merging (diverged) | Would merge the local cleanup commit with the remote's equivalent | Remote already had an equivalent cleanup commit; merge would create a duplicate | Cherry-pick the minimal fix only, not the full local commit stack |
| Deleting an orphan branch before extraction | Tempted to just `git push --delete` the broken branch | Risked losing valid skill content that lived only on the branch tip | Extract content (and check whether it is already on main) before deleting |
| Relied on `git cherry origin/main <branch>` to detect unmerged work | All commits showed `+` so branches looked unmerged | Squash-merge gives every original commit a new patch-id; cherry never matches | Use message-search (`git log origin/main --oneline \| grep '(#PR)'`) + `gh pr list --state all`, not git cherry, for squash repos |
| Considered spawning a rebase-conflict-resolution swarm for 7 conflicting branches | Conflicts existed only because the squash content already on main collides with original commits | Resolution would be "take main's side" everywhere → empty branch | Confirm subsumed first; report subsumed and stop — don't resolve, don't delete |
| Assistant tried `git worktree remove --force` / `git tag -d` / `git checkout --` | Blocked by CC Safety Net hook | Cannot override the hook even with user approval in-chat | Prove safety, then print the exact destructive command for the user to run manually |

## Results & Parameters

### State A — Superseded decision matrix

| Condition | Check Command | "Stale" Verdict |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Deletions already absent from main | `comm -23 head.txt main.txt` → each: `git log --diff-filter=D origin/main -- <path>` | consolidation commit found for all |
| Modified files have lower version | `grep "^version:" skills/<f>.md` vs `git show origin/main:skills/<f>.md \| grep "^version:"` | branch version < main version |
| "New" files already on main | `comm -23 staged_hashes.txt main_hashes.txt \| wc -l` | result = 0 |

Expected output for a fully superseded branch:

```text
# gh pr list --state open
No pull requests match your search
# comm -23 /tmp/head.txt /tmp/main.txt | wc -l
1193    ← looks alarming, but all are old deletions
# git log --diff-filter=D --oneline origin/main -- skills/old-skill.md | head -1
a3f2b1c feat(skill-merge): consolidate 12 skills into automation-bundle (C086)
# comm -23 staged_hashes.txt main_hashes.txt | wc -l
0       ← zero true new files; staged index is a no-op
```

### State A (large-scale) — Three-way count diff interpretation table

| Pattern | merge-base count | branch count | main count | Diagnosis |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Branch grew, main shrank | 1661 | 1849 | 333 | main ran corpus consolidation post-diverge; branch-only files are pre-consolidation originals |
| Branch shrank, main grew | N | N-k | N+m | branch deleted files; check if intentional or if branch is behind main |
| Both grew from base | N | N+a | N+b | two independent workstreams; inspect `comm -23` and `comm -13` carefully |
| Branch == main count | N | N | N | files differ by content, not count; use hash comparison or version comparison |

**Confirmation command sequence** for the "branch grew, main shrank" pattern:

```bash
# 1. Get counts at all three points
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)
git ls-tree -r --name-only "$MERGE_BASE" skills/ | grep '\.md$' | wc -l   # e.g. 1661
git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD            skills/ | grep '\.md$' | wc -l   # e.g. 1849
git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main     skills/ | grep '\.md$' | wc -l   # e.g. 333

# 2. Verify main ran consolidation
git log --oneline origin/main | grep -iE 'consolidat|absorb|cluster' | head -5
# Expected: "chore(triage): second-pass addendum (21 new clusters, 5 merges, C060-C080)"

# 3. Confirm branch-only count matches expected pre-consolidation originals
comm -23 /tmp/branch.txt /tmp/main2.txt | wc -l  # e.g. 970 (pre-consolidation originals)
comm -13 /tmp/branch.txt /tmp/main2.txt | wc -l  # e.g. 76 (canonical merged skills branch lacks)

# 4. Safety stash and confirm superseded commits
git stash push -u -m "pre-reset snapshot $(date +%Y%m%d)"
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD | head -10  # should show only adds/updates now on main

# 5. Only then hard-reset
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### State B — Orphan signs and recovery checklist

Signs of a wrong-repo push: unfamiliar "Initial commit" at `git log <branch> | tail`;
unexpected files at `git ls-tree --name-only <branch>`; massive ahead/behind counts; commit
messages referencing a different project.

- [ ] Verify branch has no merge-base with main
- [ ] Identify valuable content on branch tip
- [ ] Check whether content is already on main (`git log origin/main -- <path>`)
- [ ] Extract files before deletion
- [ ] Delete remote branch
- [ ] Recreate from main only if content not already merged

### State C — Reset + cherry-pick recipe

```bash
git log --oneline origin/<branch>..HEAD       # local-only commits

```

Cherry-picks of small, focused single-file fixes rarely conflict, even on heavily diverged
branches, because they touch a narrow region the remote version differs in only slightly.

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| ProjectMnemosyne | Branch `feature/myrmidon-merge-triage` (32 ahead, 730 behind, remote gone) — three-way count diff: merge-base=1661 skills, branch=1849 (grew), main=333 (shrank via consolidation). 970 branch-only files were pre-consolidation originals. Hard-reset to origin/main confirmed correct after stash. 107 PRs subsequently merged on main. | State A — large-scale corpus consolidation |
| ProjectMnemosyne | Branch `feature/myrmidon-merge-triage` (32 ahead, 525 behind, remote gone) — confirmed fully superseded; no PRs opened | State A |
| ProjectMnemosyne | Branch `skill/debugging/fixme-todo-cleanup-v2` pushed from ProjectOdyssey's history — no merge-base; content already on main; deleted | State B |
| ProjectOdyssey | PR #3197, issue #3088 — BF16 test skip; reset to remote (13 remote-only commits) + cherry-pick fix | State C |
| ProjectHephaestus | 7 local branches all failed auto-rebase with conflicts; `git cherry` showed every commit `+`. Message-search proved all subsumed: `999-fix-pr-thread-reply-mutation`→`187720a … (#1041)`, `fix-1282-work`→`22fc435 … (#1282)`, `rc2-conflict-gate`→`d3701b8 … (#1335)`. Reported subsumed; no swarm, no delete | State A — squash-merge false positive |
| ProjectHephaestus | Worktree `agent-a7fe2df2b7f6e658b` — 3 "uncommitted modified" files all 0 unique lines vs main (`log_on_error` changes already merged via PR #1372); safe to discard | State A — worktree 0-unique-lines |
