# Testing: Singleton Isolation — Circuit Breaker Reset Pattern

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-07 |
| **Objective** | Ensure test isolation for module-level singleton instances by (a) resetting the held instance state, not just clearing registries, (b) putting the autouse reset fixture in `conftest.py` at the broadest scope OR calling `module._BREAKER.reset()` at the top of any new failure-triggering test, (c) ALWAYS running the FULL unit suite (not just the changed subdirectory) so shared-state pollution surfaces, and (d) mocking EVERY new side-effecting collaborator in EVERY existing test that reaches it |
| **Outcome** | v1.0.0: 5 circuit breaker tests passing in `test_gh_call_circuit_breaker.py`. v1.1.0: cross-test contamination fixed in `tests/unit/automation/` after moving the fixture into a package-level conftest. v1.2.0: adding 2 new fail-fast tests turned 5 unrelated sibling tests red (shared `_GH_BREAKER` pushed OPEN); fixed by `module._GH_BREAKER.reset()` at each new test's top. v1.3.0: a NEW `gh_pr_resolve_thread` call was added inside a function existing tests already exercised; 2 tests left it unmocked, made real `gh` calls that fail in CI's no-network sandbox, tripped the shared `github-api` breaker, and cascaded `CircuitBreakerOpenError` into many unrelated tests. Running only `tests/unit/automation` (1174 passed) hid it; the full `tests/unit` (3391 tests) in CI exposed it. Fixed by mocking the new call in every reaching test, then running the full suite. |
| **Verification** | v1.0.0 verified-ci. v1.1.0 verified-ci (bug) / verified-local (fix). v1.2.0 verified-ci (PR #1042, closes #1040). v1.3.0 **verified-ci** — CI failure confirmed the cascade and the mock-everywhere fix made CI pass (ProjectHephaestus PR #1084, closes #1083, fix commit `83d5aaf`). |

## When to Use

- Testing code with module-level singleton instances (circuit breaker, cache, connection pool, registry, contextvar default, env-var snapshot)
- Singleton maintains internal state (failure counter, open/closed state, reset timer) across test runs
- Simply clearing a registry does not reset the held instance
- Tests must be independent and repeatably pass in any order
- Fixture must reset state both before AND after each test (setup + teardown)
- **A test passes locally in isolation but fails in CI** — classic order-dependent contamination signature
- **The same test fails identically on multiple Python versions in CI (3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13)** — singleton state is a deterministic shared resource; parallel Python versions reproduce the same test order and therefore the same contamination
- **Deciding the scope of an autouse reset fixture**: it MUST live in `conftest.py` at the broadest package scope where any contaminating test lives. Putting it in a single `test_*.py` file only protects that file
- **Adding tests that intentionally trigger failures/exceptions** to a class whose code path goes through a module-level circuit breaker / rate limiter / retry primitive — each raised exception (even a deterministic fail-fast one) counts as a breaker failure and accumulates toward the OPEN threshold
- **New tests pass in isolation but make UNRELATED sibling tests fail** with a "circuit breaker is open" / unavailable error when the WHOLE class runs in file order — the signature of shared-state pollution from a module-level singleton
- **A reset helper clears a registry** (`reset_all_circuit_breakers()` → resets each breaker then `_registry.clear()`) rather than resetting the import-time-bound instance — the helper ORPHANS the import-time `_GH_BREAKER`, so it keeps accumulating state across tests
- **Extending a non-transient / fail-fast error classifier and verifying it** — e.g. adding patterns to `_NON_TRANSIENT_PATTERNS`. The new failing-call tests you write to verify it are exactly the tests that trip the shared breaker
- **Deciding whether HTTP 422 / "unprocessable entity" or GraphQL schema errors should be retried** — they should NOT. They are deterministic; retrying can never succeed and wastes ~31s/failure (5 attempts × `2**attempt` backoff)
- **You added a NEW side-effecting call** (a `gh`/network/db/subprocess call) inside a function that EXISTING tests already exercise — every prior caller's test that does not mock the new call will now make a real call, which fails in CI's no-network sandbox and (if the call goes through a shared breaker) trips the cascade. Audit all callers' tests and add the mock (`patch.object(module, "gh_pr_resolve_thread")`) before claiming green
- **You ran only the touched subdirectory's tests** (e.g. `pixi run pytest tests/unit/automation`, saw 1174 passed) and want to declare green — DON'T. Stateful singletons (circuit breakers, caches, rate limiters) make a passing subset misleading because the breaker's failure threshold is only crossed at full scope. Run the FULL suite (`pixi run pytest tests/unit`)
- **CI output shows a cascade of `CircuitBreakerOpenError` across many unrelated tests** — treat it as a SYMPTOM, not the root cause. The first real failure(s) that tripped the breaker are the cause; find the EARLIEST non-breaker failure in the run, not the dozens of downstream breaker-open errors

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```python
# Module under test: hephaestus/automation/github_api.py
_GH_BREAKER = CircuitBreaker(fail_max=5, reset_timeout=60)

def _gh_call(cmd):
    try:
        return _GH_BREAKER.call(_gh_subprocess_call, cmd=cmd)
    except CircuitBreakerOpenError as exc:
        raise GitHubUnavailableError(...) from exc

# Test file: tests/unit/automation/test_gh_call_circuit_breaker.py
import pytest
from hephaestus.automation import github_api
from hephaestus.resilience.circuit_breaker import reset_all_circuit_breakers

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def _reset_breaker():
    """Reset circuit breaker before and after each test."""
    # IMPORTANT: Reset the held instance directly, not just registry
    github_api._GH_BREAKER.reset()
    yield
    github_api._GH_BREAKER.reset()

def test_breaker_opens_after_5_failures(monkeypatch):
    """Breaker opens after fail_max consecutive failures."""
    # Test runs with clean breaker state
    # No carry-over from previous tests
    ...

def test_breaker_closes_after_reset_timeout(monkeypatch):
    """Breaker transitions to half-open after reset_timeout."""
    # Again, clean breaker state from fixture
    ...
```

### Conftest Scope Pattern (v1.1.0)

The fixture above is correct, but its LOCATION matters as much as its content. If it lives only inside `test_gh_call_circuit_breaker.py`, sibling tests in the same package — e.g. `test_pr_reviewer_posting.py` — do NOT get reset. They will inherit the OPEN-breaker state from any earlier test that tripped it.

The fix: lift the autouse fixture into the package-level `conftest.py`.

```text
tests/unit/automation/
├── conftest.py                       # ← autouse fixture LIVES HERE
├── test_github_api.py                # ← no longer needs its own copy
├── test_gh_call_circuit_breaker.py   # ← no longer needs its own copy
├── test_pr_reviewer_posting.py       # ← now protected (was contaminated)
└── ... every other test_*.py in the subtree is automatically protected
```

```python
# tests/unit/automation/conftest.py
"""Package-level fixtures for automation tests.

Lives at the broadest scope covering any test that mutates the
GitHub circuit breaker singleton, so EVERY test in this subtree
runs with a clean breaker. Do not duplicate this fixture inside
individual test_*.py files.
"""

import pytest
from hephaestus.automation import github_api


@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def _reset_circuit_breakers():
    """Reset the GitHub circuit breaker before and after each test.

    Why here, not in a single test file?

    The `_GH_BREAKER` singleton lives at module scope in
    `hephaestus.automation.github_api`. Any test in this package
    that exercises a failure path can trip it. Once tripped, the
    OPEN state persists across test files in the same pytest
    session. Tests later in the run order then see a generic
    "circuit breaker is open" message instead of the domain
    error they were asserting on, and they fail in CI even though
    they pass locally in isolation.
    """
    github_api._GH_BREAKER.reset()
    yield
    github_api._GH_BREAKER.reset()
```

#### How to verify the scope is right

Replicate CI's order-dependent contamination in one local pytest invocation by running the contaminating file FIRST, then the previously-failing file:

```bash
pixi run pytest \
    tests/unit/automation/test_github_api.py \
    tests/unit/automation/test_pr_reviewer_posting.py \
    -v
```

If both pass, the conftest scope is broad enough. If the second file still fails with the breaker-open error, the conftest needs to be lifted higher (e.g. `tests/unit/conftest.py` or `tests/conftest.py`).

#### Choosing the right conftest level

| Where the singleton is tripped | Where the autouse reset belongs |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| One test file only             | That file (rare — usually wrong) |
| Multiple files in one package  | `tests/<package>/conftest.py`   |
| Multiple packages              | `tests/conftest.py` (top-level) |
| Across unit + integration      | `tests/conftest.py` (top-level) |

The cost of running the reset on a test that doesn't need it is negligible (a few attribute writes). The cost of a single order-dependent CI flake is hours of debugging. Default to the broader scope when in doubt.

### Fail-Fast Test Pattern (v1.2.0) — reset the bound instance at the test top

`setup_method` is not always enough. The automation test class calls
`reset_all_circuit_breakers()` in `setup_method`, but that helper resets each
registered breaker and then does `_registry.clear()`. The import-time-bound
`_GH_BREAKER` singleton in `hephaestus/automation/github_api.py` is created at
module import; once the registry is cleared, the helper no longer touches that
orphaned instance. So `setup_method` gives a FALSE sense of isolation.

The consequence: adding new tests that intentionally trigger a *fail-fast*
(non-transient) error still raises an exception, and **every raised exception —
even one that fails fast on the first attempt — counts as one breaker failure**.
With `failure_threshold=5`, adding two new failure-triggering tests near the top
of the class pushed `_GH_BREAKER` to 5 accumulated failures and OPEN. The next
five sibling tests then failed with
`GitHubUnavailableError: circuit breaker is open` — even though each new test
caused only ONE failure on its own.

The fix matches the file's existing `test_circuit_breaker_wraps_gh_call_impl`
pattern: any new test that triggers a breaker failure must reset the bound
instance DIRECTLY at the top, not rely on the registry-clearing helper.

```python
from hephaestus.automation import github_api as module

def test_my_new_fail_fast_error(monkeypatch):
    module._GH_BREAKER.reset()  # ← reset the bound instance, not the registry
    # ... arrange a deterministic 422 / GraphQL-schema failure ...
    with pytest.raises(SomeError):
        module._gh_call([...])
```

#### Why setup_method's helper does not protect it

```python
# hephaestus/resilience/circuit_breaker.py  (sketch)
def reset_all_circuit_breakers():
    for breaker in _registry.values():
        breaker.reset()
    _registry.clear()          # ← orphans any import-time-bound reference
```

`_GH_BREAKER` is bound once at import time. After `_registry.clear()`, future
calls to the helper iterate an empty registry and never touch `_GH_BREAKER`.
The held module attribute keeps its accumulated `fail_counter` / OPEN state.

#### The 422 / GraphQL-schema retry-classifier fix that motivated the new tests

`_NON_TRANSIENT_PATTERNS` in `hephaestus/automation/github_api.py` classifies
which `gh` failures are non-retryable so `_gh_call_impl` fails fast instead of
retrying 5× with `2**attempt` backoff (~31s wasted per deterministic failure).
It listed 403/404/400/401/invalid-argument/unknown-json-field/token-scope but
OMITTED HTTP 422 ("unprocessable entity") AND GraphQL schema errors. Those are
deterministic — retrying can never succeed. The fix adds three patterns:

```python
_NON_TRANSIENT_PATTERNS = [
    # ... existing 403/404/400/401/invalid-argument/... patterns ...
    r"(?:^|\s)422(?:\s|$)|unprocessable entity",
    r"doesn't accept argument",
    r"is declared by .* but not used",
]
```

Verifying that fix required adding tests that assert these errors raise WITHOUT
retrying — and those very tests are what tripped the shared breaker, which is
how the test-pollution bug surfaced.

### Run the FULL Suite Before Green (v1.3.0) — new side-effecting calls + the subset trap

This dimension is about a NEW failure mode that produced the SAME cascade
through a different door. A change added a NEW side-effecting collaborator — a
`gh_pr_resolve_thread` GitHub API call — INSIDE a validator function that
existing tests already exercised. Two of those existing tests did not mock the
new call, so when they ran they made REAL `gh` calls. In CI's no-network
sandbox those calls fail, and each failure increments the shared `github-api`
circuit breaker. After the threshold the breaker OPENED, and every SUBSEQUENT
test that touched `github_api` then failed with `CircuitBreakerOpenError` —
including many tests entirely unrelated to the change.

Why it was invisible locally: running only the touched subdirectory
(`pixi run pytest tests/unit/automation`) reported `1174 passed`. That subset
never crossed the breaker's failure threshold (or the two real-call failures
were too few to trip it within that scope), so the bug stayed hidden. CI runs
the FULL `tests/unit` (3391 tests); at full scope the failures accumulated past
the threshold and the cascade appeared.

```bash
# ❌ The trap — only the changed subdirectory; subset never trips the breaker
pixi run pytest tests/unit/automation        # "1174 passed" — misleading green

# ✅ Before declaring green — the FULL unit suite (what CI runs)
pixi run pytest tests/unit                    # surfaces the breaker cascade
```

**The fix:** when a function under test gains a new side-effecting call, audit
EVERY existing test that reaches the enclosing function and add the mock —
then run the full suite.

```python
from hephaestus.automation import some_module

# Mock the NEW side-effecting collaborator in EVERY test that reaches it
with patch.object(some_module, "gh_pr_resolve_thread") as mock_resolve:
    mock_resolve.return_value = None
    some_module.validate_and_resolve(...)
```

**Reading a `CircuitBreakerOpenError` cascade:** the breaker turns a couple of
unmocked-call failures into dozens of downstream failures. Do not chase the
`CircuitBreakerOpenError`s — scroll to the EARLIEST non-breaker failure in the
CI log; that first real failure is what tripped the breaker and is the actual
root cause.

**Under time pressure:** background a long full-suite run (`run_in_background`)
rather than skipping it. A backgrounded `pixi run pytest tests/unit` finishing
in the next turn is far cheaper than a CI-only breaker cascade.

#### Prevention checklist (v1.3.0)

1. After adding a side-effecting call to shared code, grep for ALL tests that
   invoke the enclosing function and confirm each mocks the new call.
2. Run the FULL unit suite locally before declaring green — never just the
   changed subdirectory. Stateful singletons make a passing subset misleading.
3. Treat a `CircuitBreakerOpenError` in test output as a SYMPTOM: the first real
   failure(s) that tripped the breaker are the root cause — find the earliest
   non-breaker failure, not the cascade.
4. Background long full-suite runs rather than skipping them under time pressure.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Identify the module-level singleton instance**:
   ```python
   # In hephaestus/automation/github_api.py (module level)
   _GH_BREAKER = CircuitBreaker(fail_max=5, reset_timeout=60)
   ```

2. **Understand what state the singleton holds**:
   - Circuit breaker: fail_counter, state (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN), last_failure_time
   - Cache: entries, hit/miss counts
   - Connection pool: active connections, pending queue
   - Any instance variable that persists across calls

3. **Create a pytest fixture with autouse=True**:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
   def _reset_breaker():
       """Reset circuit breaker state for test isolation."""
       # Setup: reset before test
       github_api._GH_BREAKER.reset()
       yield
       # Teardown: reset after test
       github_api._GH_BREAKER.reset()
   ```

4. **Import the module containing the singleton**:
   ```python
   import hephaestus.automation.github_api as github_api
   
   # Directly access the module-level instance
   github_api._GH_BREAKER.reset()
   ```

5. **DO NOT rely on clearing a registry alone**:
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG: This does not reset the held instance
   reset_all_circuit_breakers()  # clears registry only
   # _GH_BREAKER is still in memory with old state
   
   # ✅ CORRECT: Reset the held instance directly
   github_api._GH_BREAKER.reset()
   ```

6. **Reset both before and after (setup + teardown)**:
   - Before: ensure test starts clean even if previous test crashed
   - After: ensure next test doesn't inherit this test's state

7. **Verify isolation with parametrized tests**:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.parametrize("test_order", [0, 1, 2])
   def test_order_independent(test_order):
       """Tests should pass in any order."""
       # If isolation works, passing test_order=2 first gives same result as 0,1,2 sequence
       ...
   ```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Clearing the circuit breaker registry in conftest.py: `reset_all_circuit_breakers()` | Registry was cleared, but the module-level _GH_BREAKER instance still held old state (fail_counter=5, OPEN). Subsequent tests saw breaker still open. | Clearing a registry is not the same as resetting an instance. The held reference _GH_BREAKER is a separate object that must be reset directly. |
| 2 | Assuming pytest automatically resets module-level instances between tests | No such mechanism exists. Module-level instances persist in memory for the lifetime of the Python process. Tests inherit the previous test's state. | Fixture must explicitly reset state. No automatic cleanup without code. |
| 3 | Using `pytest.monkeypatch` to replace the breaker with a fresh one: `monkeypatch.setattr(github_api, "_GH_BREAKER", CircuitBreaker(...))` | Works, but requires instantiating a new CircuitBreaker per test (expensive). Also fragile: if later code imports _GH_BREAKER directly, monkeypatch won't affect it. | Just call reset() on the existing instance — simpler, faster, less fragile. |
| 4 | Resetting the breaker only in fixture setup, not teardown | If a test crashed or was interrupted, subsequent tests started with dirty state. Isolation was conditional on test success. | Always reset in both setup and teardown (yield pattern). Ensures clean state even if previous test failed. |
| 5 | Using module-scope fixture instead of function-scope | Multiple tests in one module share the same fixture run. Cross-test pollution still happened. | Use `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` with default function scope (resets for each test). |
| 6 | Trying to patch CircuitBreaker.reset() method | Would break actual reset calls in production code; confusing test vs. production behavior. | Don't patch the reset method; just call it normally. |
| 7 | Putting the autouse reset fixture in a single test file (`test_github_api.py`) instead of `conftest.py` | Only protected `test_github_api.py`. Sibling files in the same package (e.g. `test_pr_reviewer_posting.py`) still inherited the OPEN-breaker state. CI failed identically on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 — the deterministic test order tripped the breaker before the affected test ran. (ProjectHephaestus PR #707, fixed in commit `3e4bc10`.) | The autouse reset fixture belongs in `conftest.py` at the broadest scope covering any contaminating test, not in a single test file. |
| 8 | Widening the failing assertion to tolerate the breaker-open message (e.g. `assert '#0' in err or 'circuit breaker' in err`) | Papered over the contamination. The domain-specific `#0` diagnostic (issue-not-found) was the whole point of the test; allowing the generic breaker message meant any real regression of that diagnostic would silently slip through. | Fix the isolation, do not widen the assertion. If your test "fails" because the wrong error appeared, the wrong error is the bug, not the assertion. |
| 9 | Per-test `monkeypatch` on the singleton — `monkeypatch.setattr(github_api, "_GH_BREAKER", CircuitBreaker(...))` inside each test | Only patches the lookup `github_api._GH_BREAKER`, not the underlying held state in other modules that may have already imported the original. Also: the next test re-instantiates and the original singleton (if accessed via `import hephaestus.automation.github_api`) is still in OPEN state. | Reset the existing instance, do not replace it. `instance.reset()` is simpler, faster, and avoids reference-aliasing bugs. |
| 10 | Per-test reset inside each test function body (no fixture) | DRY violation. Easy to forget on a new test. The forgotten test then becomes the contaminator for every test that runs after it in CI order. | Use `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` in `conftest.py`. Autouse means new tests added later are automatically protected. |
| 11 | Module-level `setup_module` / `teardown_module` | Resets at module boundaries only. Tests within a module still share state with tests in OTHER modules that ran in the same pytest session. | Use a function-scoped autouse fixture in `conftest.py`, not a module-level hook. |
| 12 | Relying on `reset_all_circuit_breakers()` in the class's `setup_method` to isolate new fail-fast tests | The helper resets each registered breaker then calls `_registry.clear()`, ORPHANING the import-time-bound `_GH_BREAKER`. After the first clear, the helper iterates an empty registry and never touches the singleton, which keeps accumulating `fail_counter`. Adding 2 fail-fast tests pushed it OPEN; 5 unrelated sibling tests then failed with `GitHubUnavailableError: circuit breaker is open`. | A registry-clearing reset helper does NOT protect import-time references. Reset the actual bound object: `module._GH_BREAKER.reset()` at the top of each failure-triggering test (matches the file's `test_circuit_breaker_wraps_gh_call_impl` pattern). |
| 13 | Running only the new test in isolation to confirm it works | Each new fail-fast test PASSES alone — no prior test ran, so the shared breaker was clean. The pollution only manifests when the WHOLE class runs in file order: the new tests trip the breaker before later siblings execute. On pristine main all tests passed; adding 2 tests turned 5 siblings red. | ALWAYS run the full test class/module (not just your new test) to catch shared-state pollution. "Passes in isolation" is the trap, not the proof. |
| 14 | Letting `_gh_call_impl` retry HTTP 422 / GraphQL-schema errors (no classifier entry) | 422 ("unprocessable entity") and GraphQL schema errors ("doesn't accept argument", "is declared by ... but not used") are deterministic — retrying can never succeed. `_gh_call_impl` retried them 5× with `2**attempt` backoff (~31s wasted per failure) before raising, AND each attempt is a breaker failure that worsens pollution. | Add deterministic failures to `_NON_TRANSIENT_PATTERNS` so they fail fast on attempt 1. Patterns added: `(?:^\|\s)422(?:\s\|$)\|unprocessable entity`, `doesn't accept argument`, `is declared by .* but not used`. |
| 15 | Ran only `tests/unit/automation` locally after adding a new `gh_pr_resolve_thread` call to a validator (saw `1174 passed`), declared green | CI runs the full `tests/unit` (3391 tests). At full scope the unmocked real `gh` calls (which fail in CI's no-network sandbox) accumulate past the shared `github-api` breaker's failure threshold, OPEN it, and cascade `CircuitBreakerOpenError` into many unrelated tests. The automation subset never crossed the threshold, so the same tests "passed" locally and hid the problem. | Run the FULL unit suite (`pixi run pytest tests/unit`) before claiming green — never just the changed subdirectory. Stateful singletons (circuit breakers, caches, rate limiters) make a passing subset misleading. (ProjectHephaestus PR #1084, closes #1083, fix commit `83d5aaf`.) |
| 16 | Added a new side-effecting `gh_pr_resolve_thread` call inside a function existing tests already exercised, but left it unmocked in 2 of those existing validator tests | Those 2 tests made REAL `gh` calls that fail in CI's no-network sandbox; each failure incremented the shared `github-api` circuit breaker until it OPENED, after which every subsequent test touching `github_api` failed with `CircuitBreakerOpenError`. Chasing the dozens of breaker-open errors wasted time — they were a cascade symptom, not the cause. | When a function under test gains a new side-effecting (gh/network/db) call, audit EVERY existing test that reaches the enclosing function and add the mock (`patch.object(module, "gh_pr_resolve_thread")`). Treat any `CircuitBreakerOpenError` as a symptom and find the EARLIEST non-breaker failure that tripped the breaker. |

| Full suite command | `pixi run pytest tests/unit` | The breaker threshold is only crossed at full scope; the subdirectory subset passes misleadingly |
| Changed-subdir trap | `pixi run pytest tests/unit/automation` → `1174 passed` | False green; CI's full `tests/unit` (3391) exposed the cascade |
| New side-effecting call | `gh_pr_resolve_thread` (a GitHub API call) | Added inside a function existing tests already exercised; unmocked real calls fail in CI sandbox |
| Mock target | `patch.object(module, "gh_pr_resolve_thread")` | Mock the new collaborator in EVERY existing caller's test |
| Cascade symptom | `CircuitBreakerOpenError` across unrelated tests | Find the EARLIEST non-breaker failure — that is the root cause that tripped the breaker |
| Time-pressure rule | background the full-suite run | A backgrounded full run is cheaper than a CI-only cascade |

### v1.2.0 — Fail-Fast Test Reset + Non-Transient Retry Patterns

The one-line fix at the top of every new failure-triggering test:

```python
module._GH_BREAKER.reset()   # reset the BOUND instance, not the registry
```

The exact non-transient regex patterns added to `_NON_TRANSIENT_PATTERNS` in
`hephaestus/automation/github_api.py` so 422 / GraphQL-schema errors fail fast
(no retry, no extra breaker failures):

```python
r"(?:^|\s)422(?:\s|$)|unprocessable entity"
r"doesn't accept argument"
r"is declared by .* but not used"
```

| Parameter | Value | Why it matters |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `_GH_BREAKER` failure_threshold | 5 | Each raised exception (incl. fail-fast) = 1 failure; 5 across the class trips OPEN |
| Wasted time per un-classified deterministic failure | ~31s | 5 retries × `2**attempt` backoff before raising |
| Reset call | `module._GH_BREAKER.reset()` | Resets the import-time-bound instance directly |
| Anti-pattern | `reset_all_circuit_breakers()` in `setup_method` | Clears registry → orphans the bound singleton |
| Verification rule | run the WHOLE class/module | Pollution is invisible when the new test runs alone |

```

### CircuitBreaker.reset() Method Location

The reset() method typically appears in the breaker implementation:

```python
# hephaestus/resilience/circuit_breaker.py

class CircuitBreaker:
    def reset(self):
        """Reset breaker state to CLOSED and clear failure counter.
        
        Used for test isolation and manual recovery.
        """
        self.fail_counter = 0
        self.opened_at = None
        self.state = "closed"  # or "CLOSED" depending on implementation
```

### General Pattern: Package-Shared Singletons That Need This Treatment

The circuit breaker is one example of a broader class. Any of these singletons benefits from a package-scoped autouse reset in `conftest.py`:

| Singleton family | Concrete example | Reset method |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Circuit breakers | `_GH_BREAKER`, `_NATS_BREAKER` | `.reset()` |
| In-memory caches | `@lru_cache`, custom dict caches, `functools.cache` | `cache.cache_clear()` or `dict.clear()` |
| Registry singletons | Plugin registries, agent registries, route maps | re-register from scratch, or `.clear()` |
| `contextvars` defaults | Trace-context, request-context | `var.set(default)` |
| Env-var snapshots | A module that captures `os.environ[...]` at import | re-read env, or `monkeypatch.setenv` + reload |
| Connection pools | DB connection pools, HTTP session singletons | `.close()` + new instance |
| Time / clock state | Frozen-time monkeypatches | restore wall-clock in teardown |

Rule of thumb: if reading a module attribute at test start ever shows a value that depends on what other tests did, that attribute needs a conftest-level autouse reset.

#### Why this bites only in CI

| Symptom | Why CI shows it but local does not |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| Test passes locally in isolation | Single-test run never executes the contaminator |
| Test passes in `pytest <one_file>` locally | Other files in the package are not collected; the contaminator never runs |
| Test passes locally on full suite | Local file iteration order may differ from CI (alphabetical, but filesystem-dependent) |
| Test fails identically on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 in CI | Each Python version runs the same deterministic test order; the singleton is process-local but test-order-deterministic |
| Test passes under `pytest-xdist` workers | Each worker has its own process; the singleton is per-worker, hiding cross-file contamination unless both files land on the same worker |

The "passes locally" trap is real: running a single failing test in isolation always passes because no prior test has run.

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ProjectHephaestus | PR #633 — CircuitBreaker testing (v1.0.0) | tests/unit/automation/test_gh_call_circuit_breaker.py; 5 tests all passing; no cross-test state leakage |
| ProjectHephaestus | PR #707 — conftest scope fix (v1.1.0) | Cross-test contamination: `test_pr_reviewer_posting.py` failed identically on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 in CI because the autouse breaker reset lived only in `test_github_api.py`. Fixed by moving the fixture into `tests/unit/automation/conftest.py` (commit `3e4bc10`). 911 tests pass locally under the new conftest scope; CI re-run pending at /learn time, hence v1.1.0 is **verified-local** for the fix, **verified-ci** for the bug. |
| ProjectHephaestus | PR #1042 — fail-fast test pollution + 422/GraphQL classifier (v1.2.0) | Adding 2 new fail-fast tests to a class in `hephaestus/automation/github_api.py`'s test suite turned 5 unrelated sibling tests red (`GitHubUnavailableError: circuit breaker is open`) because `setup_method`'s `reset_all_circuit_breakers()` clears the registry and orphans the import-time `_GH_BREAKER`. Fixed by calling `module._GH_BREAKER.reset()` at each new test's top. Bundled with adding `422`/`unprocessable entity`, `doesn't accept argument`, and `is declared by .* but not used` to `_NON_TRANSIENT_PATTERNS`. **verified-ci** — merged to main (PR #1042, closes #1040). |
| ProjectHephaestus | PR #1084 (closes #1083) — full-suite-before-green + new-side-effecting-call mocking (v1.3.0) | A new `gh_pr_resolve_thread` GitHub API call was added inside a validator function existing tests already exercised. Two tests left it unmocked → real `gh` calls fail in CI's no-network sandbox → shared `github-api` circuit breaker tripped OPEN → `CircuitBreakerOpenError` cascaded into many unrelated tests. Running only `tests/unit/automation` (`1174 passed`) hid it; CI's full `tests/unit` (3391 tests) exposed it. Fixed by mocking the new call in every reaching test, then running the full suite. **verified-ci** — the CI failure confirmed the cascade and the fix made CI pass (fix commit `83d5aaf`). |
