# pytest Configuration, Discovery, and CI Pitfalls

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-07 |
| **Objective** | Canonical reference for pytest configuration, test-discovery, and CI pitfalls — dual-config conflicts, testpaths/marker discovery gaps, addopts inheritance in slim CI jobs, stale matrix patterns, watcher dependency replacement, and sys.path conftest fixes |
| **Outcome** | Synthesised from 6 absorbed skills; one general workflow for diagnosing config-shadowing, low collection counts, partial-run coverage misfires, mock leakage, date bombs, and CI matrix hygiene |
| **Verification** | verified-ci (multiple projects) |

## When to Use

- CI Python test job hits `timeout-minutes` gate on every run with no explicit failure message (hang from dangling asyncio loop / collection failure)
- pytest log shows `configfile: pytest.ini (WARNING: ignoring pytest config in pyproject.toml!)` — dual-config conflict
- Test collection count is suspiciously low (e.g., ~1691 vs ~3257 expected); `ImportError`/`ModuleNotFoundError` on a `scripts/` module at collection time
- Slim `pip install pytest` CI job crashes with `unrecognized arguments: --cov=...` or `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'` — `addopts` inherited from `pyproject.toml`
- Developers run bare `pytest` and only unit tests are discovered because `tests/integration/` is not in `testpaths`
- CI test counts differ from local collection counts — marker-based selection (`-m unit`, `-m integration`) inconsistency
- A CI matrix has `path`+`pattern` entries referencing renamed/deleted test files — stale pattern detection/removal
- `pytest-watch` (unmaintained, last 2018 release) must be replaced with an actively maintained watcher dependency
- A test is flaky only in the full suite due to class-level `patch.object(...__class__...)` or hardcoded calendar dates/Unix timestamps
- Coverage gate fires for a partial run (e.g. `pytest -m integration`) but full-suite coverage is fine
- `ModuleNotFoundError` fires when a `conftest.py` autouse fixture patches a `scripts/` module not on `sys.path` during single-file pytest runs

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1 — Detect pytest.ini shadowing pyproject.toml (dual-config conflict)
pytest --co -q 2>&1 | grep -E "configfile:|WARNING"
ls pytest.ini setup.cfg tox.ini 2>/dev/null
git rm pytest.ini            # if pyproject.toml [tool.pytest.ini_options] is authoritative

# 2 — Detect suppressed collection / low test count (pythonpath gap)
pytest --collect-only 2>&1 | grep ERROR
# Fix: pyproject.toml -> [tool.pytest.ini_options] pythonpath = [".", "scripts"]

# 3 — Discover integration tests under bare `pytest` (testpaths gap)
# pyproject.toml -> testpaths = ["tests/unit", "tests/integration"]
# Add `pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration` atop each integration file
pytest --collect-only -q | tail -1
pytest -m unit --collect-only -q | tail -1
pytest -m integration --collect-only -q | tail -1

# 4 — Slim pip CI job inheriting addopts (--cov) without pytest-cov
pip install pytest pytest-cov pyyaml          # Option A: install missing deps
pytest -o addopts= tests/test_x.py            # Option B: disable inherited addopts
pixi run pytest tests/test_x.py               # Option C (preferred): real env

# 5 — Coverage gate partial-run trap
grep -rn "fail_under\|cov-fail-under" pyproject.toml .github/workflows/ pytest.ini
# Fix: no fail_under in pyproject.toml; --cov-fail-under only on full-suite CI step

# 6 — Stale CI matrix patterns (reference 0 existing files)
grep -r "test_<name>" . --include="*.yml" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.toml"

# 7 — Replace unmaintained pytest-watch
# pixi.toml: pytest-watch = ">=4.2,<5"  ->  pytest-watcher = ">=0.4,<1"   (ptw CLI unchanged)

# 8 — YAML fixture timeout calibration: timeout = max(180, ceil(dur*3/60)*60)
grep -rn "timeout_seconds" tests/unit/
grep -rn "== 300" tests/unit/        # over-inflated fixtures / stale hardcoded assertions

# 9 — Class-level mock leakage / date-bomb detection
grep -rn "patch.object.*__class__" tests/
grep -rn "17[6-9][0-9]\{7\}\|18[0-2][0-9]\{7\}" tests/
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1 — pytest.ini Silently Shadows pyproject.toml (dual-config conflict)

**Root cause**: pytest's config-file precedence gives `pytest.ini` absolute priority. When it exists, all `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` in `pyproject.toml` are completely ignored — including `pythonpath`, `asyncio_mode`, `testpaths`, and `addopts`. A missing `pythonpath` then causes `ModuleNotFoundError` at collection; under `asyncio_mode = auto` the dangling event loop makes pytest hang forever (the classic "hangs until timeout, no failure" signature).

```bash
pytest --co -q 2>&1 | grep -E "configfile:|WARNING"   # which config is active?
cat pytest.ini
grep -A 20 '\[tool.pytest.ini_options\]' pyproject.toml
git rm pytest.ini                                      # pyproject.toml is authoritative
git commit -m "fix(test): remove pytest.ini — pyproject.toml is authoritative config"
pytest --co -q 2>&1 | head -20                         # should show configfile: pyproject.toml, no WARNING
```

**Config precedence (highest → lowest)**:

```
pytest.ini       ← WINS — completely silences pyproject.toml
pyproject.toml   ← [tool.pytest.ini_options] ignored if pytest.ini exists
setup.cfg        ← [tool:pytest] section
tox.ini          ← [pytest] section
```

Keep all pytest config in one place (`pyproject.toml`); avoid redundant `pytest.ini`/`setup.cfg` test sections.

#### Step 2 — Missing Directory on pythonpath Suppresses Collection (low test count)

**Root cause**: A non-standard source dir (e.g., `scripts/`) not listed in `[tool.pytest.ini_options] pythonpath` raises `ImportError` at collection. pytest silently skips the failing file — the test count drops with no obvious error unless you inspect `--collect-only`.

```bash
pytest --collect-only 2>&1 | grep ERROR
# pyproject.toml:  pythonpath = ["."]   ->   pythonpath = [".", "scripts"]
# Delete any manual sys.path.insert(...) workaround from individual test files
pytest -x
```

**Diagnostic signal**: hook/CI test count (~1691) vs direct `pytest` count (~3257) diverge — always compare these when investigating coverage regressions.

#### Step 3 — testpaths Gap Hides Integration Tests; Markers Enable Selection

**Root cause**: With `testpaths = ["tests/unit"]`, bare `pytest` discovers only unit tests; integration tests are silently skipped locally even though CI runs them via explicit paths. Expand `testpaths` to include all suites and add module-level markers so `-m unit` / `-m integration` filter cleanly.

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests/unit", "tests/integration"]   # was ["tests/unit"]
pythonpath = [".", "scripts"]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = ["--cov=<package>", "--cov-report=term-missing"]
markers = [
    "integration: marks tests as integration tests (deselect with '-m \"not integration\"')",
]
```

Add to the **very top** of every `tests/integration/test_*.py` (before other imports):

```python
import pytest

pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration   # auto-applies to every test function in the file
```

Verify, and confirm CI is immune (explicit CLI paths override `testpaths`):

```bash
pytest --collect-only -q | tail -1            # e.g. 3406 items collected (unit + integration)
pytest -m unit --collect-only -q | tail -1    # e.g. 3188
pytest -m integration --collect-only -q | tail -1  # e.g. 218  (3188 + 218 = 3406)
grep -n "pytest" .github/workflows/*.yml       # e.g. `pytest tests/unit` overrides testpaths
```

ALL integration files must carry the marker; missing markers make `-m unit` leak integration tests. `testpaths` controls *discovery*, markers control *selection* — you need both. Do not use `testpaths = ["tests"]` expecting recursion into subdirs; list each directory explicitly.

#### Step 4 — Slim `pip install pytest` Inherits addopts from pyproject.toml

**Root cause**: `[tool.pytest.ini_options] addopts = "--cov=<pkg> --cov-report=xml"` is injected into **every** pytest invocation, including a lightweight matrix job that ran only `pip install pytest`. With pytest-cov (or pyyaml for tests that `import yaml`) absent, the job crashes with `unrecognized arguments: --cov=...` or `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`.

```yaml
# Option A (quickest) — install all deps the addopts/tests require
- run: |
    pip install pytest pytest-cov pyyaml
    pytest tests/test_exporter.py

# Option B — override addopts inline (disables inherited flags; also disables coverage)
- run: |
    pip install pytest
    pytest -o addopts= tests/test_exporter.py

# Option C (most robust, zero dep-drift) — use the real project environment
- run: pixi run pytest tests/test_exporter.py
```

| Situation | Recommended Fix |
|-----------|----------------|
| Job must stay pip-only and needs coverage | Option A: add all missing deps |
| Job intentionally skips coverage | Option B: `-o addopts=` |
| Job can use pixi/poetry | Option C: `pixi run pytest` (always prefer) |
| `addopts` will keep accumulating deps | Option C to avoid dep-drift |

#### Step 5 — Coverage `fail_under` Fires on Partial Runs

**Root cause**: `[tool.coverage.report] fail_under = X` fires for **every** pytest invocation. A partial-run job (e.g. `pytest -m integration`) naturally covers fewer statements and trips the gate even when full-suite coverage is fine.

```toml
# pyproject.toml — REMOVE fail_under; keep the rest of the block
[tool.coverage.report]
precision = 2
exclude_lines = ["pragma: no cover", "if TYPE_CHECKING:"]
# DO NOT add fail_under here
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml — gate ONLY the full / unit suite
- name: Unit tests (gated)
  run: pixi run pytest -m "not integration" --cov-fail-under=80
- name: Integration tests (no gate)
  run: pixi run pytest -m integration -v      # no --cov-fail-under; or pass --no-cov
```

> Coverage *threshold values* and floor-enforcement policy live in the coverage-config skill (PT02), not here.

#### Step 6 — Stale CI Matrix Patterns (reference deleted/renamed files)

**Root cause**: A CI matrix lists `path`+`pattern` entries; when a test file is renamed/deleted, the pattern can match zero files (dead reference). Detect via an inverse coverage check and remove the dangling token.

```bash
# Confirm the file is actually gone (do not trust the issue description)
ls <project-root>/tests/shared/core/test_<name>.mojo 2>/dev/null || echo "File does not exist"
# Find every reference
grep -r "test_<name>" . --include="*.yml" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.toml" --include="*.mojo" -l
```

Add an inverse check to the coverage-validation script (warnings only — stale patterns are hygiene, not a blocker):

```python
def check_stale_patterns(ci_groups: Dict[str, Dict[str, str]], root_dir: Path) -> List[str]:
    """CI matrix patterns matching 0 existing test files."""
    stale = []
    for name, info in ci_groups.items():
        if not expand_pattern(info["path"], info["pattern"], root_dir):
            stale.append(name)
    return sorted(stale)
```

To remove a stale token, use the Edit tool (not `sed`) on the space-separated `pattern:` string — delete the token and its surrounding space — then re-grep to confirm no references remain. Exit code is unchanged: only the forward check (uncovered files) blocks CI.

#### Step 7 — Replace Unmaintained `pytest-watch` with `pytest-watcher`

**Root cause**: `pytest-watch` (last release 2018) pulls deprecated `docopt 0.6.2`. `pytest-watcher` is the actively maintained fork with pytest 9.x support and ships the identical `ptw` CLI (drop-in).

```toml
# pixi.toml [feature.dev.pypi-dependencies]
# OLD: pytest-watch = ">=4.2,<5"
# NEW: pytest-watcher = ">=0.4,<1"   # ptw CLI unchanged
```

```bash
pixi install                                   # regenerate lock; pulls pytest-watcher, drops watch+docopt
pixi run dev-install                           # restore editable install if pixi re-solve drops it
pixi run which ptw && pixi run ptw --help | head -5
! grep -E '^name = "docopt"' pixi.lock && echo "PASS: docopt absent"
pixi run pytest tests/unit -q                  # all tests still pass
```

Run `pixi install` *first*, then verify the `ptw` entry point; and always confirm the lockfile dropped the deprecated transitive (`docopt`). Do not change the `ptw` invocation in justfile recipes — only comments.

#### Step 8 — sys.path Guard in conftest.py for Single-File Runs

**Root cause**: `pyproject.toml` sets `pythonpath = [".", "scripts"]`, but `pythonpath` injection only happens reliably during a full collection pass from the project root. In single-file mode (`pytest tests/unit/analysis/test_figures.py`) pytest may parse the ini without fully processing `pythonpath`. An autouse fixture that calls `patch("export_data.something")` then raises `ModuleNotFoundError` at fixture setup (before any test body), because `patch()` internally does `importlib.import_module("export_data")`.

```python
# Top of tests/unit/analysis/conftest.py — below stdlib imports, before fixtures
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Ensure scripts/ is importable when tests run in isolation.
# pyproject.toml sets pythonpath=[".", "scripts"] for full-suite runs, but
# rootdir detection may not inject it during single-file collection.
_scripts_dir = str(Path(__file__).parents[3] / "scripts")   # adjust .parents[N] for conftest depth
if _scripts_dir not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, _scripts_dir)
```

`.parents[N]` = directory levels from conftest up to project root (`tests/conftest.py` → `parents[1]`; `tests/unit/analysis/conftest.py` → `parents[3]`). The guard prevents duplicate entries on full-suite runs. Use the `sys.path` guard (no importable names) rather than a bare `import scripts_module` — ruff F401 strips an unused import, but the guard block survives. Once the guard is in place, do **not** use `create=True` on the patch — the module is fully importable.

#### Step 9 — YAML Fixture `timeout_seconds` Over-Inflated (calibrate from observed duration)

**Root cause**: YAML test fixtures are often created with a generic default `timeout_seconds = 300` that is far too conservative. When many fixtures inherit this default, the cumulative job timeout is inflated (e.g., ~147,900s vs ~29,820s actually needed), tripping a pipeline-level timeout long before any individual test is slow.

**Calibration formula** — 3× observed duration, rounded up to the nearest 60s, with a 180s floor:

```
timeout_seconds = max(180, ceil(actual_duration * 3 / 60) * 60)
```

- Multiplier: 3× observed duration (head-room for CI jitter / cold caches)
- Granularity: round up to the nearest 60s
- Floor: 180s minimum

```python
import math

def calibrate_timeout(actual_duration_seconds: float) -> int:
    raw = actual_duration_seconds * 3
    rounded = math.ceil(raw / 60) * 60
    return max(180, rounded)
```

```bash
# Collect observed durations from recorded results
grep -r "duration_seconds" tests/fixtures/results/ | sort

# CRITICAL: find hardcoded assertions / over-inflated fixtures pinned to the old default
grep -rn "timeout_seconds" tests/unit/
grep -rn "== 300" tests/unit/         # surfaces tests asserting the stale 300s default
# Update any hardcoded assertion to the new floor (180) or make it data-driven, then:
git add tests/fixtures/
git commit -m "test(fixtures): calibrate timeout_seconds using 3x observed duration formula"
```

The `grep -rn "== 300"` check is the key signal: it finds both over-inflated fixtures and tests whose assertions were pinned to the old generic default. Recalibrate the data and convert assertions to be data-driven rather than re-pinning a new magic number.

#### Step 10 — Class-Level Patch Leaks Mock State; Date-Bomb Tests

**Mock leakage**: `patch.object(instance.__class__, "method", ...)` patches the **class**, not the instance. If a test fails mid-context-manager the patch stays active for all subsequent tests — even in other classes — causing order-dependent flakiness that only appears in the full suite. Fix with an autouse teardown:

```python
class TestWithClassLevelPatches:
    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def _isolate(self):
        yield
        patch.stopall()   # stops any patch left active; safe when none are
```

Find the **source** class with `grep -rn "patch.object.*__class__" tests/`, not the symptom class.

**Date bombs**: tests that hardcode a Unix epoch or calendar string (`"May 8, 5pm"` / `1778284800`) with a fixed tolerance detonate once the clock passes the window. Make them temporally reflexive:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

def test_parses_date():
    future = datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(days=2)
    input_str = future.strftime("%B %-d, %-I%p").lower()   # e.g. "may 12, 4pm"
    parsed = parse_date_string(input_str)
    assert abs(parsed - future.timestamp()) < 86400
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Increase CI `timeout-minutes` | Raised job timeout 10→20 min to stop the hang | Root cause was an infinite hang from a dangling asyncio loop / collection failure, not slow tests | Never mask a hang by raising the timeout — diagnose collection/config first |
| `sys.path.insert` workaround in test file | Manual path manipulation at the top of a test file | Works for direct runs but not hooks/CI with a different env; ruff strips an unused bare import | Fix belongs in `pyproject.toml pythonpath`, or a `sys.path` guard block (no names) in `conftest.py` |
| Use `testpaths = ["tests"]` (parent dir) | Expected pytest to recurse into subdirectories | pytest treats `tests/` as one directory; subdirs not auto-discovered | List each directory explicitly: `["tests/unit", "tests/integration"]` |
| Expand testpaths but skip markers | Added integration dir to testpaths, omitted `pytestmark` | `pytest -m unit` still ran integration tests (no marker to filter on) | testpaths controls discovery, markers control selection — add both |
| Mark only some integration files | Marked 2 of 5 files | `-m unit` leaked the unmarked integration files | ALL integration files need the marker |
| `pip install pytest` alone in slim CI | Relied on minimal install | `pyproject.toml addopts=--cov` re-injected `--cov`; pytest-cov absent → `unrecognized arguments` | `addopts` is read regardless of env; install deps, `-o addopts=`, or use `pixi run` |
| `pip install pytest pytest-cov` (no pyyaml) | Added cov plugin only | Tests did `import yaml` → `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'` | Slim jobs must list every transitive the tests need, or use the real env |
| Lower `fail_under` to match partial run | Edited 80→78 in pyproject.toml | Next full run hits 96%, next partial run hits 78% again | Don't lower the gate — apply `--cov-fail-under` only to the full-suite CI step |
| Remove `[tool.coverage.report]` wholesale | Deleted the whole block | Lost `precision`/`exclude_lines` too | Surgical: delete only the `fail_under` line |
| Raise the YAML fixture `timeout_seconds` default | Bumped the generic `300` default higher to stop pipeline timeouts | Inflated the cumulative job timeout further (~147,900s) — fewer fixtures, same magic-number problem | Calibrate per fixture: `max(180, ceil(observed*3/60)*60)`; grep `== 300` for stale assertions |
| Add `_isolate` teardown to the wrong class | Added fixture to a class that didn't leak | Leak originates elsewhere; fixing the symptom class is a no-op | `grep` for `patch.object.*__class__` to find the source class |
| Widen date tolerance 24h→7d | Stretched the window on a hardcoded epoch | Defers the failure ~5 days; doesn't eliminate it | Make the test temporally reflexive, not the tolerance bigger |
| Verify `ptw` CLI before `pixi install` | Checked the entry point before re-solving the lock | Premature — the new package's entry point isn't installed yet | `pixi install` first, then verify `ptw`; pytest-watcher ships `ptw` |
| Confirm file deletion via background `find` / pre-deletion glob | Assumed the issue description was current | Output unavailable when needed; file was already gone | Verify existence synchronously with `ls`/glob before editing patterns |
