# Ruff Specific Rule Fixes

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-30 |
| **Objective** | Fix specific Ruff rule violations (S101 assert-in-production, C901 cyclomatic complexity, RUF022 `__all__`-sort, I001 import-sort, RUF100 unused-noqa, D413 missing-blank-after-last-section) and recognize when repeated policy violations mean the linter itself is the root cause; honor the auto-discovered scripts smoke `--help` contract; fix E501/ruff-format failures in newly-added test files on large feature PRs |
| **Outcome** | Verified — S101 guards converted across 20+ sites (PRs #1142, #1211), C901 extractions verified (PRs #1546, #1050), wrong-direction linter root-cause pattern verified-CI (PRs #863/#865/#866/#867), RUF022 + I001 fixes (issue #1189); RUF100 unused-noqa + scripts smoke `--help` contract verified-precommit (PR #1250); E501/format in new test files fixed (ProjectHephaestus PR #1035); CI `ruff format --check` failure after local tests/`ruff check` fixed and merged in Inference360 PR #282; D413 trailing-blank-after-last-section fixed in ProjectHephaestus issue #1434 (verified-local) |

## When to Use

- Ruff reports **S101** (`use of assert`) in production code — `assert x is not None  # noqa: S101` precondition guards that must always run (Python's `-O` flag disables `assert`).
- Ruff or a custom hook reports **C901** (`<function> is too complex (N > 10)`) — adding conditional blocks pushed a function over the cyclomatic-complexity limit.
- Ruff reports **RUF022** (`__all__` is not sorted) or **I001** (import block is un-sorted) — both are marked `[*]` fixable by ruff itself.
- The **same policy violation** appears in 2+ independent files/configs — the linter that should enforce the policy is absent, misconfigured, or wrong-direction.
- You are deciding between a `# noqa` suppression, fixing the violation, or promoting the rule to error-level enforcement.
- You are tempted to open N parallel PRs to fix N violating files — pause and check the linter first.
- **main goes red after a ruff/mypy version-floor bump** (e.g., ruff 0.1.x to 0.15): E501 line-length overruns, ruff-format implicit-string-concat collapses, or `# type: ignore[tag]` comments become unused-ignore errors in files that previously passed CI.
- A `# type: ignore[tag]` comment fires mypy error `[unused-ignore]` after a mypy floor bump — the annotation was covering a type error that no longer exists in the new mypy version.
- You are **adding a new `scripts/*.py`** to a repo with an auto-discovering smoke test, or **adding a `# noqa: <RULE>` whose `<RULE>` may not be in the ruff `select` list** (RUF100 unused-noqa risk).
- You pushed a **large feature PR (40+ files)** after running only the test suite and CI fails on **E501 or `ruff format`** in newly-added test files — running tests does not invoke the linter; newly-added test files are subject to the same E501 line-length limit and `ruff format` rules as production code.
- A repository validate job runs `ruff format --check`, and CI fails with `Would reformat: <file>` even though local pytest, the pre-push pytest suite, and `ruff check <file>` all passed. `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` are separate gates; run both before pushing.
- You **wrote or edited a Google-style docstring** (Args/Returns/Raises) in ProjectHephaestus or any pydocstyle-**D413**-enabled repo and see `D413 Missing blank line after last section ("Raises")` — the docstring's LAST section (whichever it is) needs a blank line before the closing `"""`. Most often noticed on `Raises:` because that section is frequently last.
- A docstring **passed `ruff format` but failed `ruff check`** — D413 is a `ruff check` rule; `ruff format` neither inserts nor flags the trailing blank line. Formatting alone is not enough.
- You **added a new public function/method/classmethod** and the surrounding existing docstrings already have a blank line before their closing `"""` — match that established convention or D413 fires only on your new docstring.

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# E501 / format on a large feature PR — lint AND format-check BOTH prod + tests
pixi run ruff check hephaestus/ tests/      # E501 line-length (limit = 100)
pixi run ruff format --check hephaestus/ tests/   # format wants some lines collapsed
# Newly-ADDED test files are just as subject to E501 + ruff format as production code.
```

```bash
# Focused PR / repo validate gate — pytest + ruff check is NOT enough
python3 -m pytest -q <affected-tests>
python3 -m ruff check <changed-python-files>
python3 -m ruff format --check <changed-python-files>
# If format-check fails:
python3 -m ruff format <changed-python-files>
python3 -m ruff format --check <changed-python-files>
```

```bash
# S101 — find assert guards in production code (exclude tests)
grep -rn "noqa: S101\|assert.*is not None" <src-path>/

# C901 — locally reproduce the complexity check
pre-commit run --all-files            # ruff C901 + custom CC hook

# RUF022 (__all__ not sorted) / I001 (import block un-sorted) — both [*]-fixable
# NEVER manually reorder: isort sorts by the 'as' alias name, not the original symbol
pixi run ruff check --fix <file1> <file2>
# Running --fix on just the affected files is safe and idempotent.
# Three errors were fixed in one pass across two files (issue #1189).

# Linter-as-root-cause — count distinct files violating the SAME rule
audit_output | grep "Rule: <rule-id>" | awk '{print $2}' | sort -u | wc -l
# >= 2 distinct files  ->  fix the LINTER first, not each file

# D413 (missing blank line after last docstring section) — [*]-autofixable
# ruff format does NOT add or flag this; only ruff check does. Fastest remedy:
pixi run ruff check --fix hephaestus/nats/config.py   # auto-inserts the blank line
```

```python
# S101: assert guard  ->  explicit RuntimeError
# BEFORE
assert self.experiment_dir is not None  # noqa: S101
return self.experiment_dir / "checkpoint.json"
# AFTER
if self.experiment_dir is None:
    raise RuntimeError("experiment_dir must be set before getting checkpoint path")
return self.experiment_dir / "checkpoint.json"
```

```python
# C901: inline branches  ->  extract helpers (each gets its own CC budget)
def _restore_run_context(ctx, state):
    if condition:
        _restore_judgment(ctx)        # CC counted in helper, not parent
    if condition:
        _restore_run_result(ctx)

def _restore_judgment(ctx): ...       # starts at CC=1
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Pattern A — Fix Ruff S101 (assert -> RuntimeError)

**Key insight**: `assert` is inappropriate in production code because Python's `-O` (optimize)
flag disables all `assert` statements. Legitimate runtime guards must use explicit `raise`.

1. **Find all violations** (current line numbers, not the stale ones in the issue):

   ```bash
   grep -rn "noqa: S101" <src-path>/          # production only
   grep -rn "noqa: S101" <src-path>/ <test-path>/   # full picture; tests may legitimately keep noqa
   ```

   The grep often finds MORE asserts than the issue lists (10 vs 6 reported in `runner.py`) — fix all of them if the deliverable is "no S101 in file X".

2. **Read context around each assert** to write a message describing *what operation is blocked*, not just restating the condition. Message format: `"<attribute> must be set before <operation>"`.

3. **Classify and replace**:

   | Assert pattern | Replacement |
   | --------------- | ----------- |
   | `assert x is not None  # noqa: S101` | `if x is None: raise RuntimeError("x must be set before <op>")` |
   | `assert x is not None, "msg"  # noqa: S101` | `if x is None: raise RuntimeError("msg")` (reuse the message verbatim) |
   | `assert condition  # noqa: S101` | `if not condition: raise RuntimeError("<condition description>")` |

   **For-else defensive guard** (e.g. retry loop in `llm_judge.py`): the `else` fires only if every attempt caught a `ValueError`, so `last_parse_error` is logically never `None`. Keep the guard — protect against future breakage — do not delete it:

   ```python
   else:
       if last_parse_error is None:
           raise RuntimeError("Judge retry loop exhausted but last_parse_error is None")
       raise last_parse_error
   ```

4. **Add regression tests** to the existing test class (no new files unless a guard has no home):

   ```python
   def test_method_raises_if_x_none(self, tmp_path: Path) -> None:
       obj = MyClass(attr=None, ...)
       with pytest.raises(RuntimeError, match="attr must be set before"):
           obj.method()
   ```

   For logically-unreachable guards (the for-else case), test the *observable adjacent behavior* — that the normal exhausted-retry path re-raises `ValueError` (not `RuntimeError`) — rather than contriving a path into the guard:

   ```python
   def test_raises_value_error_not_runtime_error_when_parse_fails(self, tmp_path: Path) -> None:
       bad = "Not valid JSON at all"
       with pytest.raises(ValueError):
           self._run_with_call_side_effects(tmp_path, [(bad, "", bad)] * 3)
   ```

   Coverage may stay flat — guard paths protect against impossible states and aren't exercised. That is expected.

5. **Verify and commit**:

   ```bash
   grep -rn "noqa: S101" <src-path>/    # must be empty
   pre-commit run --all-files           # run TWICE: ruff-format reflows long raise lines on pass 1
   pixi run python -m pytest <test-path>/ -q
   ```

#### Pattern B — Fix Ruff C901 (extract helpers)

1. **Identify the violation**: CI shows the function name and CC score, e.g. `_restore_run_context is too complex (11 > 10)`.

2. **Count branches**: each `if`/`elif`/`else`/`for`/`while`/`except`/`and`/`or` adds +1. The function starts at CC=1.

   | CC | Status | Action |
   | -- | ------ | ------ |
   | 1-7 | Safe | Can add 1-3 branches freely |
   | 8-9 | Warning | One more `if/else` hits the limit |
   | 10 | At limit | Any new branch fails CI |
   | 11+ | CI failure | Must extract helpers |

3. **Extract self-contained blocks** into module-level helpers or instance methods — blocks with their own imports, operating on a clear parameter subset, not sharing mutable state beyond `ctx`/`self`. Each helper gets its own CC budget starting at 1. Keep guard clauses in the parent:

   ```python
   if is_at_or_past_state(run_state, RunState.JUDGE_COMPLETE) and ctx.judgment is None:
       _restore_judgment(ctx)

   def _restore_judgment(ctx: Any) -> None:
       """Restore ctx.judgment from on-disk judge result."""
       from scylla.e2e.judge_runner import _has_valid_judge_result, _load_judge_result
       judge_dir = get_judge_dir(ctx.run_dir)
       if _has_valid_judge_result(ctx.run_dir):
           ctx.judgment = _load_judge_result(judge_dir)
   ```

4. **Multi-pass rendering — return-value threading**: when a method runs several sequential passes that each compute state feeding the next (workers -> separator -> logs), extract each pass as an instance method that takes and returns the running offset. No shared mutable state:

   ```python
   def _refresh_display(self, screen, height, width):
       start_row = 0
       start_row = self._draw_workers(start_row, height, width)
       start_row = self._draw_separator(start_row, height, width)
       start_row = self._draw_logs(start_row, height, width)

   def _draw_workers(self, start_row: int, height: int, width: int) -> int:
       ...
       return next_row   # next free row, threaded into the following pass
   ```

   Test each helper for return-value threading, boundary handling, and truncation independently.

5. **Verify**:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files                     # ruff C901 + custom "Check Cyclomatic Complexity" hook
   pixi run python -m pytest <test-path>/ -x -q
   ```

   Do NOT use `# noqa: C901` to suppress — extract-method is the correct fix. Many repos prohibit `--no-verify` and lint suppression.

#### Pattern C — Linter as root cause of repeated policy violations

When an audit flags the SAME rule violated in **2+ independent files**, the file count (not line
count) is the signal: two violations in one file are a localized bug; two in unrelated files are a
systemic one. The linter/validator that should enforce the policy is the FIRST suspect.

1. **Tally findings by rule ID**:

   ```bash
   jq -r '.findings[].rule' audit.json | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn   # JSON
   grep -oP 'Rule:\s*\K\S+' audit.md | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn      # text
   ```

2. **Locate the linter's rule definition** (read BOTH the good-pattern and bad-pattern sides):

   ```bash
   grep -rn "<rule-keyword>" <validation-module-path>/ <validation-tests-path>/ scripts/audit_*.py
   ```

3. **Locate the META source** the rule claims to enforce — `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, branch-protection rules. Read its statement verbatim.

4. **Diff linter assertion vs META source**:

   | Linter says | META says | Verdict |
   | ----------- | --------- | ------- |
   | Accept X, reject Y | Require X, prohibit Y | Linter correct — violations are real bugs; fix per-file |
   | Accept Y, reject X | Require X, prohibit Y | **Linter is WRONG-DIRECTION — fix linter FIRST** |
   | No assertion | Require X, prohibit Y | Linter has a gap — add the assertion, then fix files |

   If wrong-direction, the dependent files were written to COMPLY WITH the wrong linter — they are downstream consumers of a wrong contract, not independently buggy.

5. **Re-sequence PRs**: linter fix (validator + flipped test assertions, as ONE atomic PR) lands first; dependent file fixes land on top of main afterward. Opening per-file fixes first means CI rejects the correct pattern.

6. **Add pair-direction regression tests** so a future contributor with the same mental model can't flip the direction again:

   ```python
   def test_accepts_required_pattern(self):
       assert is_compliant("<required-pattern>")
   def test_rejects_prohibited_pattern(self):
       assert not is_compliant("<prohibited-pattern>")
   ```

7. **If META is also wrong** (e.g. CLAUDE.md says `--rebase` but branch protection disables rebase merge), the deployed config is ground truth — fix META first, then linter, then dependents. Confirm via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/<branch>/protection`.

#### Pattern D — Adding a new `scripts/*.py` (RUF100 unused-noqa + smoke `--help` contract)

> **Verification: verified-precommit** (ProjectHephaestus issue #1214 / PR #1250, 2026-06-12).
> Caught and fixed locally via `pixi run ruff check`, the auto-discovered smoke test,
> and `pre-commit run`; full CI not yet confirmed green at capture time.

Two tightly-coupled findings share the same search surface: *adding a new
`scripts/*.py` to a ProjectHephaestus-style repo*.

**Finding A — `# noqa: <RULE>` is RUF100 (unused-noqa) when `<RULE>` is NOT in ruff `select`.**

A `subprocess.run([...])` call written with `# noqa: S603` triggered
`RUF100 Unused noqa directive` because `S603` is absent from this repo's ruff
`select` list:

```toml
# pyproject.toml — only specific S-rules are enabled, NOT broad "S" or "S603"
select = ["E","F","W","I","N","D","UP","S101","S102","S105","S106","B","SIM","C4","C901","RUF"]
```

This is a concrete instance of dimension (5) — *deciding between adding a noqa,
fixing the violation, or promoting the rule*. **Decision rule: noqa only for
rules you actually `select`; otherwise the noqa is dead and itself RUF100-flagged.**
Before adding a `# noqa: X`, confirm `X` is in `select` (or covered by an enabled
broad family). For a static-literal `subprocess.run` arg list (no `shell=True`),
no enabled bandit rule fires, so **no noqa is needed at all** — remove it.

```python
# BAD — S603 is not selected, so the directive is dead -> RUF100 unused-noqa
subprocess.run(["git", "status"], check=True)  # noqa: S603
# GOOD — static literal args, no shell; nothing fires; no noqa
subprocess.run(["git", "status"], check=True)
```

**Finding B — every `scripts/*.py` is auto-discovered into a smoke test with a strict `--help` contract.**

In ProjectHephaestus, `tests/unit/scripts/conftest.py` auto-parametrizes EVERY
`scripts/*.py` into
`tests/unit/scripts/test_scripts_smoke.py::test_script_help_exits_zero`. That test
runs `python scripts/<name>.py --help` and asserts BOTH `returncode == 0` AND
`assert combined.strip()` (stdout+stderr non-empty) — UNLESS the basename is in the
`HELP_RUNS_REAL_WORK` allowlist.

Any new `scripts/*.py` MUST honor `--help`/`-h` by printing something AND have a
module docstring (so `print(__doc__)` is non-empty). Otherwise the auto-discovered
smoke test fails the moment the file lands — even for a one-liner guard script.
**Do NOT reach for `HELP_RUNS_REAL_WORK`; genuinely honor `--help`.**

```python
"""One-line module docstring — required so print(__doc__) is non-empty."""

def main() -> int:
    if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] in ("--help", "-h"):
        print(__doc__)
        return 0
    ...
```

Also: ruff **D103** (missing-docstring-in-public-function) is NOT ignored for
`tests/**` here — per-file-ignores only drops `S101,D102,D107` (`"tests/**" =
["S101","D102","D107"]`). New test functions therefore need one-line docstrings
or ruff fails.

#### Pattern E — Fix retroactive violations after a ruff/mypy floor bump

When a PR raises the ruff or mypy version floor (e.g., `ruff >= 0.15` from `0.1.x`), files
that passed CI when they were merged can suddenly violate rules the new toolchain enforces more
strictly. These violations are **not regressions in the file** — they are retroactive enforcement.

**Three common retroactive violation types:**

**D1 — ruff-format implicit string-concat collapse (two-literal to one-literal)**

ruff 0.15 auto-collapses adjacent implicit two-literal concatenations. Symptom: ruff-format
reports "would reformat" even after you run `ruff check --fix`.

```python
# BEFORE (implicit two-literal concat that ruff 0.15 collapses):
pyproject.write_text(
    "[project]\n"
    "name = 'foo'\n"
)

# AFTER (join into one literal — verify identical bytes, no missing \n):
pyproject.write_text(
    "[project]\nname = 'foo'\n"
)
```

Verify: the joined string produces identical bytes — check that `\n` separators between
fragments are preserved and that no content is lost.

**D2 — E501 line-length overruns**

E501 fires when a line exceeds `line-length` (commonly 100 chars). Two sub-patterns:

*Shell `printf` inside a Python f-string (use bash line continuation):*

```python
# BEFORE (110-char line inside triple-quoted f-string):
script = f"""
printf '%s\\t%s\\n' "$A" "$B_with_a_very_long_variable_name_that_pushes_past_100_chars_here"
"""

# AFTER (bash line continuation \<newline> inside the f-string):
script = f"""
printf '%s\\t%s\\n' "$A" \\
  "$B_with_a_very_long_variable_name_that_pushes_past_100_chars_here"
"""
```

Key insight: a backslash-newline inside a Python triple-quoted f-string is literal `\<newline>`;
bash interprets it as line continuation. The shell command is semantically identical.
Verify by running the generated script in a bash subshell after the change.

*One-line docstring exceeding the limit:*

```python
# BEFORE (106-char single-line docstring):
def foo():
    """Very long docstring that exceeds the 100-character line-length limit in pyproject.toml."""

# AFTER (two-line form):
def foo():
    """Very long docstring that exceeds the 100-character line-length
    limit in pyproject.toml."""
```

**D3 — mypy `[unused-ignore]` on a `# type: ignore[tag]` comment**

When mypy's type inference improves in a new version, it may solve a type error it previously
could not. The `# type: ignore[tag]` annotation is now unused and mypy fires `[unused-ignore]`.

```python
# BEFORE (mypy 1.x could not infer the generic, so [type-arg] was needed):
result: subprocess.CompletedProcess = subprocess.run(...)  # type: ignore[type-arg]

# AFTER (two-part fix):
#   1. Remove the stale comment
#   2. Add the correct generic parameter (text=True implies stdout/stderr are str)
result: subprocess.CompletedProcess[str] = subprocess.run(...)
```

Determining the correct type argument:

- `text=True` or `encoding=...` passed to `subprocess.run` means `[str]`
- `text=False` (the default) means `[bytes]`

Confirm with `pixi run mypy <file>` — must report zero errors including `[unused-ignore]`.

**D4 — Root cause pattern and discovery workflow**

These violations merged under the old floor and passed CI at the time. The floor-bump PR is
what makes them visible. All four violation types can appear together; fix them in one PR.

```bash
# Discover all retroactive violations after a floor bump:
pixi run ruff format --check .   # find format violations (D1)
pixi run ruff check .            # find lint violations including E501 (D2)
pixi run mypy                    # find unused-ignore errors (D3)

# Apply auto-fixable repairs:
pixi run ruff format .           # apply D1 format fixes
pixi run ruff check --fix .      # apply auto-fixable lint fixes

# Manually fix remaining E501 overruns and unused-ignore comments.
# Then verify clean:
pixi run ruff format --check .
pixi run ruff check .
pixi run mypy
```

Important: the `lint` job MUST be a required CI check. If it is advisory-only, retroactive
violations merge silently (as happened with PR #1308 when `lint` was not required).

#### Pattern F — E501 / ruff format failures in newly-added test files on a large feature PR

> **Verification: verified-ci** (ProjectHephaestus PR #1035, 2026-06-13).

On a large feature PR (40+ files), newly-added test files are just as subject to **E501
(line-length)** and **`ruff format`** as production code. Running only the test suite before
pushing does not invoke the linter or formatter — CI will fail on E501 or format in the new
test files even if all tests pass locally.

**Always run ruff check AND ruff format --check over BOTH source and test directories before
pushing a large PR:**

```bash
# E501 / format on a large feature PR — lint AND format-check BOTH prod + tests
pixi run ruff check hephaestus/ tests/      # E501 line-length (limit = 100)
pixi run ruff format --check hephaestus/ tests/   # format wants some lines collapsed
# Newly-ADDED test files are just as subject to E501 + ruff format as production code.
```

**Two opposite fix shapes for E501 violations:**

**(F1) Long literal that still overflows after wrapping the container — extract the literal:**

Hand-wrapping only the `for`-header or call-signature does not help if the literal itself
overflows 100 chars. Extract the literal to a variable first:

```python
# BAD — hand-wrapping the for-header still leaves the literal past col 100
for command, module_path, attr in [
    ("hephaestus", "hephaestus.__main__", "main"),
    ("hephaestus-cli-a-very-long-entry-point-name-that-overflows-the-100-char-limit", "hephaestus.cli", "cli_main"),
]:
    ...

# GOOD — extract the literal to a named constant
ENTRY_POINTS = [
    ("hephaestus", "hephaestus.__main__", "main"),
    (
        "hephaestus-cli-a-very-long-entry-point-name-that-overflows-the-100-char-limit",
        "hephaestus.cli",
        "cli_main",
    ),
]
for command, module_path, attr in ENTRY_POINTS:
    ...
```

**(F2) Hand-wrapped call that `ruff format` collapses — stop hand-wrapping it:**

If `ruff format` keeps rewriting a hand-wrapped call back onto one line, the call already
fits within the line-length limit and ruff's style is the single-line form. Stop fighting it:

```python
# BAD — hand-wrapping subprocess.run that fits on one line; ruff format undoes this every time
result = subprocess.run(
    ["git", "status"],
    check=True,
)

# GOOD — let ruff format collapse it; this is within the limit
result = subprocess.run(["git", "status"], check=True)
```

**Positive convention folded in from PR #1035:**

For cross-cutting CLI flag rollouts (e.g., `--version` across all entry points), use:

- A composable `add_version_arg(parser)` helper so the flag is added identically everywhere.
- A parametrized integration test:
  ```python
  @pytest.mark.parametrize("command,module_path,attr", ENTRY_POINTS)
  def test_version_flag(command: str, module_path: str, attr: str) -> None:
      """Each entry point exposes --version and exits zero."""
      result = subprocess.run([command, "--version"], capture_output=True, text=True)
      assert result.returncode == 0
  ```
  This pattern makes the ENTRY_POINTS list the single source of truth and forces the same
  line-length discipline on every parametrized row.

**F3) CI validate runs `ruff format --check` separately from `ruff check`:**

Some repos put format checking inside a higher-level validation target (e.g. `just validate`).
In that setup, the following local sequence is insufficient:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_setup_workflow.py
python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_governance_docs.py
python3 -m ruff check tests/test_setup_workflow.py
git diff --check
# pre-push hook runs pytest -q only
```

That exact sequence missed a formatter-only issue in Inference360 PR #282. GitHub CI
failed `validate` with:

```text
Would reformat: tests/test_setup_workflow.py
1 file would be reformatted, 51 files already formatted
```

Fix it by running `ruff format` on the reported file, committing the formatter-only diff,
and verifying both gates:

```bash
python3 -m ruff format tests/test_setup_workflow.py
python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_setup_workflow.py tests/test_governance_docs.py
python3 -m ruff check tests/test_setup_workflow.py
python3 -m ruff format --check tests/test_setup_workflow.py
```

#### Pattern G — Fix Ruff D413 (missing blank line after last docstring section)

> **Verification: verified-local** (ProjectHephaestus issue #1434 / `hephaestus/nats/config.py`, 2026-06-30).
> `pixi run ruff check` clean and `pixi run mypy` (448 source files) + 26 unit tests passed
> locally after the fix; full CI for that PR not yet confirmed green at capture time.

ProjectHephaestus enables pydocstyle rule **D413** ("Missing blank line after last section")
via ruff. It fires on the **LAST** section of a Google-style docstring regardless of which
section it is (Args/Returns/Raises) — but is most commonly noticed on `Raises:` because that
section is frequently last. The error text is:

```text
D413 [*] Missing blank line after last section ("Raises")
```

**Key insight: `ruff format` does NOT add this blank line and does NOT flag it — only
`ruff check` does.** A docstring can therefore pass `ruff format` cleanly yet fail
`ruff check`. Because D413 is marked `[*]` (autofixable), `ruff check --fix` inserts the
blank line for you.

The fix is a blank line after the final section's content, before the closing `"""`:

```python
# BEFORE — D413: closing quotes immediately follow the last section's content
def from_env(cls) -> "NATSConfig":
    """Build a config from environment variables.

    Returns:
        A populated NATSConfig instance.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a numeric env var is not a valid number.
    """    # <-- D413 violation: no blank line before the closing quotes

# AFTER — compliant: one blank line before the closing triple-quote
def from_env(cls) -> "NATSConfig":
    """Build a config from environment variables.

    Returns:
        A populated NATSConfig instance.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a numeric env var is not a valid number.

    """    # <-- compliant
```

**Why pre-existing code passed but the new code did not.** In ProjectHephaestus the
class-level `NATSConfig` docstring already had this trailing blank line, so pre-existing
code was clean — the convention is established repo-wide. New docstrings added to the same
file must match it; D413 fires only on the new ones that omit the blank line.

**Steps:**

1. Run `ruff check` (not just `ruff format`) on the new/edited docstrings — `ruff format`
   will report clean while `ruff check` reports `D413`.
2. Apply the fix — fastest is the autofix, since D413 is `[*]`:

   ```bash
   pixi run ruff check --fix hephaestus/nats/config.py
   ```

   Or manually insert one blank line before the closing `"""` of the docstring's last section.
3. Verify clean:

   ```bash
   pixi run ruff check hephaestus/nats/config.py   # must report no D413
   pixi run mypy                                    # still clean
   ```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Suppress C901 with `# noqa: C901` | Considered suppressing the complexity warning instead of refactoring | Project prohibits `--no-verify` and lint-rule suppression | Extract-method is the correct fix, not suppression |
| Inline all restore logic in one function | Added judgment + run_result restore as new `if` blocks in a function already at CC~8 | CC went to 11, exceeding the C901 limit of 10 | Check the CC budget before adding branches to a function near the limit |
| Contrive a test into an unreachable guard | First S101 for-else test used a `StopIteration` trick to hit the logically-unreachable `RuntimeError` guard | The guard cannot fire in normal operation; the trick was brittle and abandoned | Test observable adjacent behavior (normal exhausted-retry path), not the unreachable guard path |
| Skip the second pre-commit run | Ran `pre-commit` once after converting asserts | ruff-format reflowed the longer `raise RuntimeError(...)` lines and reported "files were modified" | The `if ... raise` form is longer than the assert; run pre-commit twice (reflow, then confirm clean) |
| Open N parallel PRs to fix N violating files | 2 separate PRs to fix `--rebase`->`--squash` in two skill files | The validator enforced the WRONG direction (required `--rebase`, rejected `--squash`); the new PRs would fail CI on the correct pattern | When >=2 files violate the same rule, the linter is the first suspect — read its rule definition before per-file PRs |
| Fix linter and dependent files in one PR | Considered bundling validator + all doc fixes into one mega-PR | Linter and doc changes have different test surfaces; bundling makes CI feedback ambiguous | Keep the linter fix as its own atomic PR; dependent fixes land afterward |
| Flip only the validator, not its tests | Planned to update validator code but leave its test suite | Validator tests still asserted the wrong direction — the linter PR itself fails CI | Validator source + its tests are one atomic change; flip both together |
| Single-direction regression test | Wrote a test asserting only "accepts `--squash`" | A future agent with the same wrong-direction model could re-flip the assertion and ship it | Pair tests: assert correct accepted AND wrong rejected, to prevent silent drift |
| Manual reorder of `__all__` with `as` aliases | Tried to alphabetize `__all__` entries and import block by hand when ruff reported RUF022 + I001 | isort orders by the **alias** name (the `as <name>` part), not the original symbol — naive alphabetical order of original names produces a different sequence that ruff still rejects | Always use `pixi run ruff check --fix <files>` for RUF022 and I001; these are `[*]`-fixable and the sort order is non-obvious when `as` aliases are present |
| Only run `ruff check` after floor bump, missed ruff-format violations | Ran `pixi run ruff check .` and saw no output; assumed the repo was clean post-bump | `ruff check` (lint) and `ruff format --check` (formatter) are separate tools; a two-literal implicit concat collapse is a FORMAT violation, not a lint violation | Always run BOTH `ruff format --check .` AND `ruff check .` after a floor bump |
| Remove `# type: ignore[type-arg]` without adding the type parameter | Deleted the stale comment but left `subprocess.CompletedProcess` without a type argument | Bare `subprocess.CompletedProcess` without `[str]` still causes a mypy `type-arg` error in strict mode, creating a different failure | Always pair unused-ignore removal with the correct generic parameter; use `text=True` to `[str]`, `text=False` to `[bytes]` |
| Break the shell printf line with Python string continuation | Used Python line continuation (backslash at end of a string-literal line) inside an f-string | Python line continuation splits the Python source string, not the shell command; the resulting shell string is malformed | Use bash line continuation (backslash + newline as literal content inside the triple-quoted f-string); Python passes it through literally and bash interprets it as line continuation |
| Treat floor-bump violations as belonging to the bump PR | Tried to retroactively amend the original files that introduced violations | The violations pre-exist in files merged under the old floor; the bump PR is not the commit that introduced them | Create a new dedicated fix PR against main; do not rewrite the floor-bump PR history |
| Add `# noqa: S603` to silence a presumed bandit finding | Annotated a static-literal `subprocess.run([...])` with `# noqa: S603` | `S603` is not in the repo's ruff `select` list, so the directive is dead -> `RUF100 Unused noqa directive` | Remove the noqa — and it wasn't needed at all (static literal args, no `shell=True`); noqa only for rules you actually `select` |
| Ship a new `scripts/*.py` guard without a `--help` branch | Added a one-liner guard script with no `--help`/`-h` handling | The auto-discovered `test_script_help_exits_zero` runs `--help` and asserts exit 0 AND non-empty output — it failed the moment the file landed | Honor `--help`/`-h` -> `print(__doc__)`; add a module docstring; don't reach for `HELP_RUNS_REAL_WORK` |
| Omit docstrings on new pytest test functions | Wrote new test functions under `tests/` without docstrings | ruff `D103` (missing-docstring-in-public-function) is NOT ignored for `tests/**` (per-file-ignores drops only `S101,D102,D107`) | Add a one-line docstring to every new public test function |
| Pushed 44-file feature PR after only running the test suite | Ran `pixi run python -m pytest` locally; all tests passed; pushed to CI | CI failed on E501 in newly-added test files — the test runner does not invoke ruff check or ruff format | Always run `pixi run ruff check <src>/ tests/` AND `pixi run ruff format --check <src>/ tests/` before pushing any PR that adds new files |
| Ran pytest and `ruff check`, skipped `ruff format --check` | In Inference360 PR #282, ran focused pytest, `ruff check tests/test_setup_workflow.py`, `git diff --check`, and a pre-push full pytest suite | GitHub `validate` still failed because the repo's validation target ran `ruff format --check` and found `tests/test_setup_workflow.py` would be reformatted | Add `ruff format --check <changed-python-files>` to the local checklist whenever CI has a formatter gate; `ruff check` does not imply formatting is clean |
| Hand-wrapped a long `for`-header to fix E501 in a test file | Broke the `for command, module_path, attr in [...]` header onto multiple lines | The long string literal inside the list still overflowed col 100 — wrapping the header does not shorten the literal | Extract the literal list to a named constant (e.g., `ENTRY_POINTS`) so each row can be broken independently |
| Hand-wrapped `subprocess.run(...)` call across multiple lines | Split `subprocess.run(["git", "status"], check=True)` onto 3 lines to "look tidy" | `ruff format` kept collapsing it back to one line on every run — the call already fit within the line-length limit | Stop hand-wrapping calls that fit on one line; `ruff format` is the canonical style authority — let it collapse them |
| Ran only `ruff format` and assumed docstrings were compliant | After writing new Google-style docstrings, ran `pixi run ruff format` (clean) and assumed lint was clean too | `ruff format` neither adds nor flags the trailing blank line — D413 is a `ruff check` rule; the two tools cover different rule sets | Always run `ruff check` (not just format) on new docstrings; `ruff format` clean does NOT imply `ruff check` clean |
| Wrote a Google-style docstring ending its `Raises:` block immediately followed by `"""` | Closed the docstring with the closing triple-quote on the line directly after the last `Raises:` entry | pydocstyle **D413** requires a blank line after the LAST section (whichever it is) | Add a blank line before the closing triple-quote, or run `ruff check --fix` (D413 is `[*]`-autofixable) |

## Results & Parameters

### S101 conversions (verified)

```text
Issue #1066 / PR #1142: 16 asserts replaced (10 in runner.py, 6 in stages.py),
                        16 noqa removed, 3185 tests pass, 78.09% coverage (>=75%)
Issue #1143 / PR #1211: 4 remaining sites converted (workspace_manager.py x2,
                        llm_judge.py for-else, runner.py _finalize_test_summary),
                        4 regression tests added, 3261 tests pass, 78.39% coverage,
                        zero S101 suppressions remain in scylla/
```

Representative replacement messages: `"experiment_dir must be set before getting checkpoint path"`,
`"agent_result must be set before finalize_run"`, `"commit must be set before calling _checkout_commit"`,
`"Judge retry loop exhausted but last_parse_error is None"`,
`"_state must be initialized before finalizing test summary"`.

### C901 configuration

- **Ruff C901**: `max-complexity = 10` (in `pyproject.toml` lint config).
- **Custom hook**: `Check Cyclomatic Complexity` — runs separately from ruff at the same threshold; both must pass for CI green.

### RUF100 unused-noqa + scripts smoke `--help` contract (verified-precommit)

- **ruff `select` (ProjectHephaestus `pyproject.toml`)** — a `# noqa: X` whose `X`
  is not here is dead and RUF100-flagged:

  ```toml
  select = ["E","F","W","I","N","D","UP","S101","S102","S105","S106","B","SIM","C4","C901","RUF"]
  ```

  Only specific S-rules (`S101/S102/S105/S106`) are enabled — NOT broad `S` or `S603`.

- **per-file-ignores** — `D103` is NOT dropped for tests, so new test functions
  still need docstrings:

  ```toml
  "tests/**" = ["S101","D102","D107"]
  ```

- **scripts smoke-test assertion** (`tests/unit/scripts/test_scripts_smoke.py::test_script_help_exits_zero`,
  auto-parametrized by `tests/unit/scripts/conftest.py` over every `scripts/*.py`):
  `returncode == 0` **AND** `combined.strip()` (stdout+stderr non-empty), unless the
  basename is in `HELP_RUNS_REAL_WORK`.

- **`--help` idiom** every new `scripts/*.py` must implement (plus a module docstring):

  ```python
  if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] in ("--help", "-h"):
      print(__doc__)
      return 0
  ```

### Linter-as-root-cause re-sequencing template

```text
WRONG ORDER (fails CI):           CORRECT ORDER:
  PR1: fix file_A   <- rejected     PR1: fix linter (validator + flipped tests)
  PR2: fix file_B   <- rejected     PR2: fix file_A (depends on PR1)
                                    PR3: fix file_B (depends on PR1)
                                    PR4: fix META source (only if META also wrong)
```

### Inference360 validate CI format gate

**Context:** Inference360 PR #282 (`Require setup installer checksums`) changed
`tests/test_setup_workflow.py`. Local focused pytest, `ruff check`, `git diff --check`,
and the pre-push full pytest suite all passed. GitHub `validate` failed anyway because the
repo's validation recipe included `ruff format --check`.

**CI failure signature:**

```text
Would reformat: tests/test_setup_workflow.py
1 file would be reformatted, 51 files already formatted
```

**Fix and verification:**

```bash
python3 -m ruff format tests/test_setup_workflow.py
python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_setup_workflow.py tests/test_governance_docs.py
python3 -m ruff check tests/test_setup_workflow.py
python3 -m ruff format --check tests/test_setup_workflow.py
git diff --check
```

**Outcome:** pushed a formatter-only follow-up commit to PR #282. GitHub `validate`,
`secrets`, `sast`, `python-sca`, and CodeQL all passed; auto-merge merged the PR.

### D413 missing-blank-after-last-section (verified-local)

**Context:** ProjectHephaestus issue #1434 — adding `NATSConfig.from_env()` and helper
functions to `hephaestus/nats/config.py`. `ruff format` passed and the code was correct, but
`pixi run ruff check` failed with **three** D413 errors.

**Exact error text:**

```text
D413 [*] Missing blank line after last section ("Raises")
```

**Before/after (the one load-bearing change is the blank line before `"""`):**

```python
# BEFORE — D413
    Raises:
        ValueError: If a numeric env var is not a valid number.
    """

# AFTER — compliant
    Raises:
        ValueError: If a numeric env var is not a valid number.

    """
```

**One-line fix (D413 is `[*]` auto-fixable):**

```bash
pixi run ruff check --fix hephaestus/nats/config.py
```

**Verification:** `pixi run ruff check` clean and `pixi run mypy` (448 source files) + 26
unit tests passed locally after the fix. Verification level: **verified-local** — not yet
confirmed in CI for that PR at capture time.
