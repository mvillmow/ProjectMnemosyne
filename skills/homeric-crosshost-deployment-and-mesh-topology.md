# HomericIntelligence Cross-Host Deployment and Mesh Topology

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-20 |
| **Objective** | Deploy and operate the HomericIntelligence mesh across multiple Tailscale hosts using NATS JetStream, compose overlays, justfile launchers, and resilient publish patterns; and plan credential-based authentication for the credential-less NATS leaf/server config |
| **Outcome** | Deployment patterns verified-local (two-host + 6-host). The NATS leaf/server auth fix is still an UNVERIFIED PLAN for issue #176 (R1, post-NOGO) — the full plan was not run end-to-end and no CI passed. BUT the config-block-presence validator was PROTOTYPED this session (verified-local: exit 0 on the fixed fixture, exit 1 on the repo's current configs). The Grafana anonymous-access hardening (issue #206) is an UNVERIFIED PLAN — no container was run; the load-bearing untested assumption is that Grafana's `/api/health` stays unauthenticated when anonymous access is disabled (so e2e health probes survive). The NATS TLS security RUNBOOK (issue #208 — cert provisioning, rotation, compromise response) is an UNVERIFIED PLAN — no commands run, no CI. The ProjectTelemachy NATS client-cert mTLS wiring (issue #304) is an UNVERIFIED PLAN overall (no CI) but R1 (post-NOGO) VERIFIED-LOCAL several facts the R0 round had only flagged as reviewer-risk: **(a)** Telemachy has NO live `nats.connect()` call (`_monitor_completion` HTTP-polls Agamemnon, it is not a NATS subscriber — re-confirmed); **(b)** Hermes does NOT consume `build_ssl_context()` at its connect site — `grep` shows ONLY the method DEFINITION at `config.py:126`, and `publisher.py:91-97` calls `nats.connect(...)` with NO `tls=` kwarg, so "wire it exactly as Hermes does" mirrors a connect site that DOES NOT EXIST (Hermes has the same latent gap); **(c)** nats-py **2.14.0** `nats.aio.client.Client.connect` really accepts `tls`, `tls_hostname`, and `tls_handshake_first` (inspect `Client.connect`, NOT the module-level `nats.connect` wrapper, which does not expose them); **(d)** the root + Telemachy `.gitignore` block committed `*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.crt` fixtures AND neither `cryptography` nor `trustme` is installed in the Telemachy pixi env — but the `openssl` binary IS on PATH (OpenSSL 3.6.2), so the working approach is to generate certs at test time into pytest `tmp_path`; **(e)** ADR-009 does NOT exist (only 001-008; ADR-008 IS the NATS TLS encryption ADR) and `docs/runbooks/enable-nats-auth.md` is ABSENT — both cited by the issue. Because a config-builder alone CANNOT satisfy AC1 ("Telemachy connects to NATS"), the honest fix is to ADD a minimal real consumed `nats_client.connect_nats()` (CLI `run` `tls://` preflight), not ship an unconsumed `nats_connect_kwargs()` helper (YAGNI, flagged in the NOGO). **IMPORTANT premise correction:** the #176-era claim that `configs/nats/*.conf` ship with NO TLS is now STALE — ADR-008 (Status: Proposed) is already merged into the configs, so both `server.conf` and `leaf.conf` now carry top-level `tls {}`, `leafnodes { port=7422; tls{} }`, and cluster TLS referencing `/etc/nats/certs/{server-cert.pem,server-key.pem,ca.pem}`, and leaf.conf's remote is now `nats+tls://<ip>:7422`. The plan's highest-value content remains its catalogue of uncertain assumptions a reviewer must verify, now sharpened by concrete NOGO causes and the stale-premise correction. **R2 increment (#304):** the R1 plan PASSED review (no new NOGO), and the `cli.py` preflight insertion point is now CONFIRMED — the `tls://` preflight (`nc = await connect_nats(settings); await nc.drain()`) goes INSIDE the existing `_run_with_signals()` async wrapper (`cli.py:141`, already used by the `run` command at `cli.py:120` with SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers + a Rich `Progress` context), AFTER the signal handlers are installed and BEFORE the `async with AgamemnonClient(...)` block (`cli.py:178`); do NOT add a second `asyncio.run` or block at import time. |
| **Verification** | unverified OVERALL for the NATS auth-planning section (the full plan was not exercised end-to-end); the brace-depth config-block validator specifically is verified-local (prototyped 2026-06-19 against fixed + current fixtures). The Grafana anonymous-access hardening subsection is unverified (no container run; `/api/health`-unaffected claim untested). The NATS TLS security-runbook section (issue #208) is unverified (no commands run; `step` CLI flags, NATS SIGHUP cert hot-reload, and the `/varz` `tls_required` field name were all written from memory). The Telemachy mTLS-wiring section (issue #304) is unverified OVERALL (no CI), but R1 (post-NOGO) CONVERTED the prior round's assumed-by-analogy claims into VERIFIED-LOCAL facts this session: the nats-py `tls=`/`tls_hostname` kwargs are confirmed on `nats.aio.client.Client.connect` for the installed **nats-py 2.14.0** (via `inspect.signature`); Hermes' `build_ssl_context()` is confirmed DEFINED-BUT-UNUSED at its connect site (`publisher.py:91-97` passes NO `tls=`); `cryptography`/`trustme` are confirmed ABSENT from the Telemachy pixi env while the `openssl` binary (3.6.2) IS present; and `.gitignore` is confirmed to block `*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.crt`. Still verified this round: the ABSENCE of a live `nats.connect()`, of ADR-009 (ADR-008 is the TLS ADR), and of `enable-nats-auth.md`. The exception: the `.gitignore` cert-key coverage claim (`*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.crt`/`secrets/`/`*.secret`) was actually grepped from the file this session and is TRUE. R2 (#304) adds one verified-local detail: the `cli.py` structure (the `run` command at `:120` wraps execution in `_run_with_signals()` at `:141`, which opens `async with AgamemnonClient(...)` at `:178`) was read this session, confirming the preflight insertion point; the R1 plan also PASSED review (no NOGO). Verified-local for all prior deployment content (Odysseus sessions 2026-04-03 to 2026-05-03). |

## When to Use

- Splitting the HomericIntelligence E2E compose stack across multiple physical machines
- Configuring NATS connections (direct or leafnode) over Tailscale mesh networking
- Bringing up Agamemnon, Nestor, or Hermes natively (binary/uvicorn) or via podman on any Tailnet host from cold state
- Launching myrmidon Python workers across Tailnet hosts (fan-out or hub+remote-worker pattern)
- Adding justfile recipes that launch C++ binaries or delegate to submodule justfiles
- Choosing between compose overlay vs native binary vs per-component launcher deployment
- Implementing NATS JetStream publish retry with exponential backoff and jitter in Python
- Debugging cross-host service communication, NATS leafnode config, or podman networking issues
- Planning credential-based authentication for the canonical credential-less `configs/nats/leaf.conf` + `server.conf` (issue #176) and reviewing such a plan for unverified assumptions
- Planning Grafana anonymous-access hardening in `docker-compose.e2e.yml` (issue #206) — disabling `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED`, falling back to admin login, and reviewing the unverified `/api/health` / provisioning assumptions
- Planning a NATS TLS security runbook (issue #208) — cert provisioning (step-ca), zero-downtime cert rotation (SIGHUP), and key-compromise response — against the canonical configs that NOW carry TLS per ADR-008, and reviewing the unverified `step`/`nats-server`/`/varz` claims
- Planning NATS client-cert mTLS wiring into ProjectTelemachy (issue #304) — config-layer helpers because Telemachy has NO live `nats.connect()` site — now with R1 (post-NOGO) verified-local facts: Hermes' `build_ssl_context()` is DEFINED-BUT-UNUSED at its connect site (no `tls=` kwarg — the "exactly as Hermes does" analogy mirrors a site that does not exist); nats-py 2.14.0 `Client.connect` accepts `tls`/`tls_hostname` (inspect `Client.connect`, NOT the `nats.connect` wrapper); generate test certs with the `openssl` binary into pytest `tmp_path` because `.gitignore` blocks PEM fixtures and no cert lib is installed; ADR-008 (not the cited ADR-009) is the real NATS TLS ADR; and a config-builder alone cannot meet AC1 — add a minimal real consumed `connect_nats()` rather than an unconsumed helper (YAGNI)

### Critical Binary Names and Paths

```
CORRECT:  control/ProjectAgamemnon/build/debug/ProjectAgamemnon_server
WRONG:    control/ProjectAgamemnon/build/debug/agamemnon

CORRECT:  control/ProjectNestor/build/debug/ProjectNestor_server
WRONG:    control/ProjectNestor/build/debug/nestor

CORRECT:  PYTHONPATH=src uvicorn hermes.server:app
WRONG:    uvicorn hermes.server:app     (no PYTHONPATH — module not found)
WRONG:    uvicorn hermes.main:app       (module does not exist)

CORRECT:  ~/.local/bin/nats-server -js  (use full path — not in PATH by default)
WRONG:    nats-server -js               (bare name, command not found on most hosts)

NATS:     port 4222 = client pub/sub;  port 8222 = HTTP monitoring
```

### Native Mesh Bringup (single host, pixi available)

```bash
# 1. NATS (binary NOT in PATH — use full path)
~/.local/bin/nats-server -js &

# 2. Agamemnon — build inside pixi for correct conda toolchain
pixi run bash -c "
  cd control/ProjectAgamemnon
  cmake -B build/debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \

# 5. Verify
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health    # {"service":"ProjectAgamemnon","status":"ok"}

curl -s http://localhost:8222/varz | python3 -c \
  "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('connections:', d['connections'])"
```

### Multi-Host Cold-Start Strategy (up to 6 Tailnet Hosts)

| Host | Odysseus Present | Strategy | Special Notes |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| titan, aeolus, athena | No | `gh repo clone` + podman containers | Agamemnon build ~5-10 min (Conan C++ deps) |
| artemis | Yes, pixi available | Native build inside `pixi run bash -c "..."` | Must use `-DProjectAgamemnon_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF` |
| hephaestus | No | Clone fresh, native build | Nestor needs `-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS='-lz'` |
| apollo | No | Python 3.7 — too old for Hermes | Use `docker run --network=host` for all services |

**Pre-check**: `ls ~/<project-root>` — clone via `gh repo clone` if missing.

```bash
# Podman container build (hosts without native toolchain)
gh repo clone HomericIntelligence/Odysseus ~/<project-root>
cd ~/<project-root> && git submodule update --init --recursive
podman build -t agamemnon control/ProjectAgamemnon/
podman run -d --name agamemnon --network=host agamemnon
```

**Hermes Dockerfile**: requires `prometheus_client` in pip install; use `HERMES_PORT=8085` (not 8080 — conflicts with Agamemnon). Fixed in PR #415.

### Compose Overlay Pattern for Cross-Host Splits

```yaml
# docker-compose.crosshost.yml (overlay on docker-compose.e2e.yml)
services:
  nestor:
    profiles: ["disabled"]     # runs on control host as native binary
  argus-exporter:
    environment:
      - NESTOR_URL=http://${CONTROL_HOST_IP}:8081
```

```bash
podman compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml -f docker-compose.crosshost.yml up -d
```

**Disable-via-overlay pattern**: `profiles: ["disabled"]` is the correct way to exclude a service from an overlay without removing it from the base compose file.

### NATS Connection Strategy: Direct vs. Leaf Node

| Topology | Recommended | Reason |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 2 hosts, 1 remote client | Direct connection | Zero additional complexity; Tailscale handles routing |
| 2+ hosts, multiple remote clients | Leaf node | Reduces WAN connections; local pub/sub for co-located services |
| Hub-and-spoke (many remotes) | Leaf nodes per spoke | Each spoke gets local NATS; leaf auto-reconnects |

**Leafnode config — critical**: leaf.conf must connect to port **7422** (leafnode listen port), **NOT** port 4222 (client port).

```hcl
# server.conf (hub)
leafnodes { port = 7422 }

# leaf.conf (spoke)
leafnodes {
  remotes [{ url: "nats-leaf://<hub-ip>:7422" }]
}
```

## Proposed Workflow — Planning NATS Leaf/Server Auth (UNVERIFIED, issue #176)

> **Warning:** This section is an UNVERIFIED PLAN. No code was run, no CI passed,
> and the NATS version behaviors below were not exercised. Treat every step as a
> hypothesis until CI confirms. The highest-value content here is the
> reviewer-risk catalogue in **Results & Parameters** — read it before trusting any step.

The canonical `configs/nats/leaf.conf` and `configs/nats/server.conf` ship with NO
authentication: the `leafnodes {}` listener accepts anonymous leaf connections, so any
host that can reach port 7422 can join the mesh and relay traffic. This is the plan for
closing that hole. `configs/` is canonical — fixing it propagates to every host that
copies the config.

> **STALE-PREMISE CORRECTION (2026-06-20, issue #208):** The "ship with NO TLS / NO auth"
> premise above is the #176-era state and has DRIFTED. ADR-008 ("Require TLS for All NATS
> Inter-Service Communication", Status: Proposed) is now MERGED into the configs: both
> `server.conf` and `leaf.conf` carry top-level `tls {}` blocks, `leafnodes { port=7422;
> tls{} }`, and cluster TLS, all referencing `/etc/nats/certs/{server-cert.pem,
> server-key.pem,ca.pem}`; leaf.conf's remote is now `nats+tls://<ip>:7422`. The auth
> (credential) gap may still exist, but the **TLS gap is closed**. LESSON: re-read the
> canonical configs every session before asserting their security posture — a documented
> gap may already be closed by a later ADR/PR. See the **NATS TLS Security Runbook** section
> and its reviewer-risk catalogue below for the full #208 plan.

### Proposed Steps

1. **Add `authorization {}` to BOTH the client listener AND the `leafnodes {}` listener
   in `server.conf`.** A leafnode listener without its own authorization stays open even
   if the client listener is authed — they are independent. Do not assume top-level
   `authorization {}` covers the leafnode listener.
2. **Add a credential to each `leaf.conf` `remotes` entry.** Prefer
   `credentials = ".../leaf.creds"` (NKey/JWT, per-leaf, individually revocable). A
   `token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"` is an acceptable bootstrap fallback only. **Keep the URL
   on port 7422 — never 4222** (4222 is the client port; leaf remotes pointed at 4222
   silently fail to connect).
3. **Reference secrets via NATS env substitution** (`$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN`), mirroring the
   existing `$NATS_MONITORING_PASSWORD` pattern already in the configs. Never commit
   secret values.
4. **Treat `configs/` as canonical** — the fix lands once and propagates to every host
   that copies or symlinks the config.
5. **Enforce with a fail-closed lint wired into the EXISTING runner/CI gate.** This repo
   is `just` / `pixi`, **NOT** pytest. Add a shell validator invoked by
   `just validate-configs` (which CI must call). The gate **must strip comments before
   grepping** so a commented-out example does not satisfy the check, and it must assert
   per-block (the leafnode block has its own authorization) rather than file-wide.
6. **Auth is a NEW architectural decision → write a NEW append-only ADR (ADR-009).**
   Never edit an accepted ADR.

```hcl
# server.conf — PROPOSED (both listeners authed)
authorization {
  user = "$NATS_CLIENT_USER"
  password = "$NATS_CLIENT_PASSWORD"
}
leafnodes {
  port = 7422
  authorization {                 # leafnode listener needs its OWN block
    token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"     # or per-leaf user/account + .creds
  }
  tls { ... }                     # NOTE: nested block — see awk-parser risk below
}
```

```hcl
# leaf.conf — PROPOSED (authed remote, still port 7422)
leafnodes {
  remotes [
    {
      url: "nats-leaf://<hub-ip>:7422"
      credentials: "/etc/nats/creds/leaf.creds"   # preferred; revocable per-leaf
      # token: "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"                  # bootstrap fallback only
    }
  ]
}
```

### Canonical Config-Block-Presence Check — Brace-Depth Validator (verified-local, R1)

**This is the validated heart of the R1 plan.** The NOGO killed the first plan because its
validator stopped at the first `}` — which closes the nested `tls {}`, not the `leafnodes {}`
block. A config-block validator MUST track brace DEPTH (count `{` vs `}`), never stop at the
first close brace. Prototyped this session: exit 0 on the fixed fixture, exit 1 on the repo's
current (unauthed) `configs/nats/server.conf`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# validate-configs (wired into `just validate-configs`; CI must invoke it explicitly).
# Extract a named brace-block by DEPTH, stripping comments first, then assert auth inside it.
set -euo pipefail

# block FILE BLOCKNAME -> prints the contents of the first top-level BLOCKNAME { ... },
# tracking nested braces by depth so nested tls{}/jetstream{} do NOT close it early.
block() {
  local file="$1" name="$2"
  sed 's/#.*//' "$file" | awk -v blk="$name" '
    $0 ~ blk"[[:space:]]*\\{" && depth==0 { inblk=1 }
    inblk {
      n=gsub(/\{/,"{"); m=gsub(/\}/,"}");
      depth += n - m;
      print;
      if (depth<=0 && started) { inblk=0 }
      if (n>0) started=1
    }
  '
}

# Assert the leafnodes{} listener carries its OWN authorization{} (per-block, not file-wide).
if ! block configs/nats/server.conf leafnodes | grep -q 'authorization'; then
  echo "FAIL: server.conf leafnodes{} listener has no authorization{} block" >&2
  exit 1
fi
echo "OK: leafnodes listener is authenticated"
```

Verification discipline that makes this gate real (all learned from the NOGO):

```bash
# Assert BOTH directions — a validator that always exits 1 "passes" the bad-case check
# for the WRONG reason and silently rejects the FIX too.
./validate-configs                 # MUST exit 0 on the fixed config
git stash && ! ./validate-configs  # MUST exit 1 on the unfixed config
git stash pop

# Fail-closed must be TESTED, not asserted: render the config with the token UNSET and
# grep for the leaked literal. Install a pinned nats-server in CI and run it unconditionally
# — never gate the check on `command -v nats-server` (that turns it into a silent no-op).
NATS_LEAF_TOKEN= nats-server -t -c configs/nats/server.conf 2>&1 \
  | grep -q '\$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN' && { echo "FAIL: unset token leaked as literal"; exit 1; }
```

### Agamemnon API Shape (Confirmed)

```bash
# Health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health
# Returns: {"service":"ProjectAgamemnon","status":"ok"}

# Create team — response wraps ID under .team.id
TEAM_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/teams \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"my-team","description":"..."}' \
  | jq -r '.team.id')   # NOT .id

# Create task — team-scoped path (NOT /v1/tasks)
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/teams/$TEAM_ID/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"my-task","type":"echo","params":{}}'

# Complete task — echo tasks require external PATCH (no autonomous executor)
curl -s -X PATCH "http://localhost:8080/v1/teams/$TEAM_ID/tasks/<task_id>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"completed"}'
```

### Multi-Host Myrmidon Fan-Out

```bash
# On each reachable remote host — always use main.py (Python), NOT main.cpp
NATS_URL=nats://<controller-tailscale-ip>:4222 \
  nohup python3 provisioning/Myrmidons/hello-world/main.py \
  > /tmp/hello-myrmidon.log 2>&1 &

# Verify cross-host NATS connection count
curl -s http://<hub-ip>:8222/varz | jq .connections
```

### NATS JetStream Publish Retry with Exponential Backoff

```python
import asyncio, json, random, time, nats

_RETRYABLE_PUBLISH_ERRORS = (
    nats.errors.TimeoutError,
    nats.errors.NoRespondersError,
    nats.errors.DrainTimeoutError,
    nats.errors.ConnectionReconnectingError,
    nats.errors.StaleConnectionError,
)

async def publish_with_retry(js, subject, message, retries=3, base_delay=0.1, timeout=5.0):
    last_exc = None
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            return await js.publish(subject, message, timeout=timeout)
        except _RETRYABLE_PUBLISH_ERRORS as exc:
            last_exc = exc
            if attempt < retries - 1:
                delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), 2.0) * random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)
                await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    raise last_exc
```

Retry budget defaults (`retries=3`, `base_delay=0.1s`, `timeout=5.0s`): ~15.3s worst case.
Non-retryable errors (`AuthorizationError`, `BadSubjectError`, generic `Exception`) propagate immediately.

### Host-Network Workaround (rootlessport absent)

```bash
# SYMPTOM: start-stack.sh hangs at `podman wait --condition=healthy`
# ROOT CAUSE: rootlessport absent — bridge networking never binds host ports
kill $(cat /run/user/$(id -u)/containers/networks/aardvark-dns/aardvark.pid 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null || true
podman run -d --name hi-nats --network=host nats:alpine -js -m 8222
# When using --network=host, Grafana datasources must use localhost, not service names
```

**Grafana on air-gapped hosts** — add to grafana service to prevent startup hang:

```yaml
environment:
  - GF_ANALYTICS_REPORTING_ENABLED=false
  - GF_ANALYTICS_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES=false
  - GF_ANALYTICS_CHECK_FOR_PLUGIN_UPDATES=false
```

#### Grafana anonymous-access hardening (planning learning, UNVERIFIED, issue #206)

> **Warning:** This subsection is an UNVERIFIED PLAN. No container was run this

> endpoint stays unauthenticated when anonymous access is disabled — so the e2e

The Odysseus e2e compose stack ships Grafana with anonymous viewer access enabled.
To CLOSE that (issue #206 asks to *disable*, not downgrade to a lower role):

```yaml
# docker-compose.e2e.yml — grafana service environment (PROPOSED)
environment:
  - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false                     # disable anonymous access
  # REMOVE GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE entirely — it is DEAD config once anon is off
  # With anon off, Grafana falls back to login → MUST supply an admin credential:
  - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=${GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER:-admin}
  - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}
```

**Pattern rules (reusable across HomericIntelligence compose stacks):**

1. To disable anonymous access set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED: "false"` AND **remove**
   `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE` — once anonymous is off the role var is dead config and
   leaving it invites a reviewer to think anonymous is merely downgraded, not disabled.
2. With anonymous off Grafana falls back to its login screen, so the stack MUST provide an
   admin credential. Use env-overridable defaults
   (`${GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER:-admin}` / `${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}`) to keep the e2e
   stack one-command. The `admin/admin` default is a DELIBERATE trade-off — name it
   explicitly so a reviewer can object; it is overridable via env, but the bootstrap default
   can silently become the permanent posture (same shape as the NATS shared-token risk above).
3. **KEY UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION (highest reviewer risk):** Grafana's `/api/health` is
   unauthenticated REGARDLESS of anonymous-access settings, so disabling anon does NOT break
   the e2e health probes (`e2e/run-hello-world.sh`, `run-crosshost-e2e.sh`,
   `run-hermes-hub-e2e.sh`, `e2e/doctor.sh` all curl `:3001/api/health`). This was asserted
   from Grafana docs knowledge, NOT verified in-session. A reviewer/implementer MUST confirm
   at runtime that `/api/health` still returns `database=ok` with anon disabled.
4. **SECOND UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION:** dashboards/datasources are file-provisioned via read-only
   volume mounts (`/etc/grafana/provisioning`), so they do NOT depend on the anonymous API and
   survive the change. Confirm provisioning still loads after login is required.

**Scoping (and its risk):** the plan changes ONLY `docker-compose.e2e.yml` at the Odysseus
root. Evidence: the overlays (`docker-compose.crosshost.yml`, `e2e/docker-compose.*.yml`)
define no grafana service; `build/.worktrees/*` are throwaway; ProjectArgus/ProjectKeystone are
separate submodules out of scope (sibling `provisioning/ProjectKeystone/k8s/grafana.yaml` is a
different deployment surface). The issue names `docker-compose.e2e.yml` at the Odysseus root.
**Reviewer risk:** confirm no other CANONICAL compose file in the Odysseus root re-enables
anonymous Grafana, and that the per-issue submodule boundary is correct.

**Verification discipline — structural compose validation is NOT runtime validation:**

```bash
# compose config passing proves SYNTAX ONLY — it never starts Grafana or probes health.
podman compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml config >/dev/null   # syntax only — NOT proof

# The load-bearing claim (health probe still green with anon off) needs an ACTUAL run:
podman compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up -d grafana
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/health    # MUST still return {"database":"ok",...}
# And confirm provisioning survived login-required mode (datasources/dashboards present).
```

Cited line numbers seen once this session (may have drifted — re-grep before editing):
`docker-compose.e2e.yml:154-155` (`GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED`), `:153-159` (anon block),
`:160-162` (admin creds region), sibling `provisioning/ProjectKeystone/k8s/grafana.yaml:95,100-101`,
`docs/e2e-walkthrough-report.md:290`.

## Proposed Workflow — NATS TLS Security Runbook (UNVERIFIED, issue #208)

> **Warning:** This section is an UNVERIFIED PLAN. No commands were run, no CI passed.
> The `step` CLI flags, the NATS SIGHUP cert hot-reload behavior, and the `/varz`
> `tls_required` field name below were ALL written from memory, NOT exercised. Treat every
> command as a reviewer-must-verify hypothesis. The highest-value content is the
> reviewer-risk catalogue in **Results & Parameters** — read it before trusting any step.

Issue #208 (§9) reported there is no runbook for NATS authentication setup or certificate
rotation. The plan adds `docs/runbooks/nats-security.md` (TLS cert provisioning, rotation,
compromise response) plus one row in `docs/README.md`'s runbook index. This is the
operational-runbook complement to the #176 NATS-auth planning above.

**Premise the whole plan rests on (CORRECTED):** the canonical configs are NO LONGER
credential-less for TLS. ADR-008 (Status: **Proposed**) already added full TLS to both
`server.conf` and `leaf.conf`: top-level `tls {}`, `leafnodes { port=7422; tls{} }`,
cluster TLS — all referencing `/etc/nats/certs/{server-cert.pem,server-key.pem,ca.pem}`,
with the leaf remote now `nats+tls://<ip>:7422`. The runbook OPERATIONALIZES this existing
TLS config; it does not introduce it.

### Proposed Steps (cert lifecycle)

1. **Provision certs with `step-ca`** (`/etc/nats/certs/`), matching ADR-008's path
   convention. Permissions: private key `600`, cert + CA `644`. **`step` flags below are
   UNVERIFIED — `step ca init` flags in particular vary by version:**

   ```bash
   # UNVERIFIED step CLI syntax (written from memory; confirm against installed step version)
   step ca init --name "HomericIntelligence" --dns ca.internal --address :443 --provisioner admin
   step ca certificate "<host>" /etc/nats/certs/server-cert.pem /etc/nats/certs/server-key.pem --san <ip>
   step ca root /etc/nats/certs/ca.pem
   chmod 600 /etc/nats/certs/server-key.pem
   chmod 644 /etc/nats/certs/server-cert.pem /etc/nats/certs/ca.pem
   ```

2. **Scenario 2 — zero-downtime rotation via SIGHUP (UNVERIFIED claim).** The plan claims
   `kill -HUP <nats-server pid>` makes NATS re-read the cert files in place without dropping
   JetStream state. NATS DOES support config reload on SIGHUP, but whether the running
   version re-reads cert files in-place (vs requiring a full restart) was NOT exercised.
   **If SIGHUP does NOT re-read certs, the "zero-downtime" claim is false** and a full
   restart is needed — and per the **After NATS Restart** section, Agamemnon and Nestor do
   NOT auto-reconnect, so they must be manually restarted too. Tie the claim to a verified
   reload signal before trusting it.

   ```bash
   # UNVERIFIED: replace the cert files on disk, then signal a reload
   kill -HUP "$(pgrep -f nats-server)"     # claim: hot-reloads TLS certs, JetStream survives
   # If this does NOT re-read certs, a full restart is required (then restart Agamemnon+Nestor)
   ```

3. **Scenario 3 — key-compromise response.** Revoke the compromised cert, rotate the CA if
   the CA key is compromised, re-issue all leaf/server certs, push to every host (`configs/`
   is canonical), reload/restart. `step ca revoke --cert <cert>` — **flag UNVERIFIED.**

4. **Verify TLS is actually required (UNVERIFIED field name).** The plan greps the NATS
   monitoring API:

   ```bash
   # UNVERIFIED: the exact JSON key for "TLS required on client port" was NOT confirmed
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8222/varz \
     | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('tls_required'))"
   ```

5. **Do NOT edit ADR-008.** CLAUDE.md principle 3: ADRs are append-only — once accepted,
   never edited. The plan's optional back-reference line into ADR-008's References is
   DROPPABLE. Prefer one-directional linking (runbook → ADR); discoverability is satisfied
   by the `docs/README.md` index row alone.

6. **Confirm ADR-008 is still the source of truth.** Its Status is "Proposed", not
   "Accepted". The cert-path convention, permissions, and three provisioning strategies are
   treated as settled by the plan — confirm ADR-008 has not been superseded before relying
   on them.

### Discipline that was DONE RIGHT this session (contrast with #176's fabrication)

- **`.gitignore` cert-key coverage was actually GREPPED, not assumed.** `*.pem`, `*.key`,
  `*.crt`, `.env`, `.env*.local`, `secrets/`, `*.secret` are ALL present in `.gitignore`, so
  cert keys / creds won't be committed. This is the correct discipline — it directly
  reinforces the #176 lesson that the EARLIER `.gitignore` claim was fabricated. Grep the
  actual file; don't infer coverage from a convention.

- **Use `ls docs/runbooks/` to enumerate runbooks — NOT the `docs/README.md` table.** The
  README runbook table (lines ~35-41) is hand-maintained and already MISSING existing
  runbooks `branch-protection-rollout.md` and `no-silent-failures.md`. The index drifts;
  don't trust it as a complete inventory.

### Compose Healthchecks (Dual-Runtime: podman-compose 1.5.0 + Docker Compose v2/v5)

```yaml
# CORRECT — YAML string form; Docker Compose v2 and v5 both treat it as CMD-SHELL
healthcheck:
  test: "wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/v1/health 2>/dev/null || exit 1"
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 3s
  retries: 10
  start_period: 10s

# For nats:alpine (BusyBox wget rejects combined -qO- flag)
healthcheck:
  test: "wget -q -O /dev/stdout http://localhost:8222/healthz 2>/dev/null | grep -q ok"
```

#### Distroless app images — binary self-probe healthcheck (planning learning, unverified)

> **Unverified planning learning (R2, issue #154).** The self-probe pattern below was
> derived from a plan, NOT tested end-to-end. No container was built or observed reaching
> `healthy`. Treat it as the correct distroless-safe shape, but confirm at runtime.

**Rule:** distroless `static`/`base` images (`gcr.io/distroless/static-*`,
`gcr.io/distroless/base-*`) contain ONLY the static binary — **no shell, no wget, no curl,
no busybox**. A `wget`/`curl`/`sh` healthcheck command simply does not exist in the
container, so it fails permanently and the service never reports `healthy`. Compose
healthchecks ALWAYS run inside the container, so there is no shell-free external-tool
option. The ONLY in-container probe is the binary self-checking.

```yaml
# Distroless runtime (gcr.io/distroless/static-*): NO shell/wget/busybox.
# The ONLY in-container probe is the binary self-checking. Requires the app
# binary to expose a -healthcheck flag (localhost GET /healthz, exit 0/1).
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "/argus-dashboard", "-healthcheck"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 15s   # Go/static binaries cold-start; avoid early flapping
```

**Cross-issue coordination note:** the self-probe creates a dependency on the binary owning
a `-healthcheck` flag. When the Dockerfile/binary is delivered by a different issue/PR than
the compose wiring, name that flag explicitly as a blocking note — never assume it exists.

**Verification discipline (do BOTH — structural config validation is insufficient):**

```bash
# Assert the healthcheck does NOT shell out to wget/sh (would fail on distroless)
docker compose config | grep -A4 'healthcheck' | grep -q '/<binary>' && ! (docker compose config | grep -E 'test:.*wget')
# Post-build, assert the container ACTUALLY reaches healthy (config alone is insufficient)
docker compose ps | grep -E '<service>.*healthy'
```

Issue #304 asks to wire NATS client-cert mTLS into ProjectTelemachy so it presents a client
cert to a `verify_and_map=true` NATS server. The plan's load-bearing finding reshapes the task.

### Load-Bearing Finding: Telemachy has NO live `nats.connect()` site (VERIFIED-LOCAL, R1, #304)

```bash
# Verified this session — returns NOTHING:
grep -rn "nats.connect\|import nats\|from nats" provisioning/ProjectTelemachy/src
```

`executor.py:265-300` (`_monitor_completion`) is **HTTP polling of Agamemnon `get_tasks`**, NOT
a NATS subscription. CONSEQUENCE: the issue's "wire these into the NATS client connection"
requirement has **no existing connection site to modify**.

**AC scope trap (R1):** "Telemachy connects to NATS" CANNOT be met by a config builder alone. The
R0 plan proposed shipping `build_ssl_context()` + an unconsumed `nats_connect_kwargs()` helper — but
a helper nobody calls is YAGNI (flagged in the NOGO) and does not make Telemachy connect. The HONEST
fix that genuinely satisfies AC1 (not narrows it) is to ADD a real, CONSUMED connection site: a
`nats_client.connect_nats()` invoked from the CLI `run` path as a `tls://` preflight handshake.

- `build_ssl_context()` loads CA + client cert/key into an `ssl.SSLContext`, and
- `connect_nats()` (the new minimal consumer) actually calls
  `nats.connect(url, tls=ctx, tls_hostname=host)` as a preflight — rather than handing a dict to a
  hypothetical future caller.

**Insertion point CONFIRMED (VERIFIED-LOCAL, R2, #304).** The preflight belongs INSIDE the existing
`_run_with_signals()` async function (`cli.py:141`), which the `run` command (`cli.py:120`) already
uses to wrap execution with SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers and a Rich `Progress` context. Put
`nc = await connect_nats(settings); await nc.drain()` AFTER the signal handlers are installed and
BEFORE the `async with AgamemnonClient(...)` block (`cli.py:178`). **LESSON:** when adding an async
preflight to a Typer CLI command, locate the existing `asyncio.run(_inner())` wrapper and insert
inside it — do NOT add a second `asyncio.run` or block at import time.

**The Hermes-analogy is a trap (VERIFIED-LOCAL, R1, #304).** The premise "ProjectHermes is already
mTLS-capable / wire it exactly as Hermes does" (per #304 / parent #175) is TRUE only at the CONFIG
layer. `grep -rn "tls=\|build_ssl_context\|ssl_context" infrastructure/ProjectHermes/src/` returns
ONLY the method DEFINITION at `config.py:126`; `publisher.py:91-97` calls
`nats.connect(url, allow_reconnect=False, connect_timeout=..., disconnected_cb=..., reconnected_cb=...)`
with NO `tls=` kwarg. So Hermes builds an `SSLContext` but does NOT wire it into its NATS connection —
it has the SAME latent gap. A plan that says "wire it exactly as Hermes does" is building on a
connect-site analogy that DOES NOT EXIST. **REVIEWER LESSON:** grep the actual call site before
asserting a reference implementation "already does X"; a defined-but-unused helper is a trap. (Hermes'
own `test_tls_config.py` only asserts context CREATION against a NON-EXISTENT `/fake/ca.pem` path —
it never calls `load_cert_chain`, so it does not even prove the loading path.)

### Proposed config-layer helper + real consumer (nats-py kwargs VERIFIED-LOCAL on 2.14.0)

```python
# config layer — build the SSLContext.
import ssl

def build_ssl_context(ca_path, cert_path, key_path) -> ssl.SSLContext:
    ctx = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.SERVER_AUTH, cafile=ca_path)
    ctx.load_cert_chain(certfile=cert_path, keyfile=key_path)  # client cert for mTLS — raises on malformed PEM
    return ctx

# VERIFIED-LOCAL (R1, #304): on the installed nats-py **2.14.0**
# (importlib.metadata.version('nats-py')), inspect.signature(nats.aio.client.Client.connect)
# shows `tls`, `tls_hostname`, AND `tls_handshake_first` are all real parameters.
# NOTE: the module-level `nats.connect` wrapper does NOT expose `__version__` and the params
# live on `Client.connect`, not the wrapper — inspect `nats.aio.client.Client.connect`.
import nats

async def connect_nats(url, ssl_ctx, server_hostname):
    # The REAL consumer (CLI `run` tls:// preflight). NOT an unconsumed kwargs dict (YAGNI).
    return await nats.connect(url, tls=ssl_ctx, tls_hostname=server_hostname)
```

### Test path and the `.gitignore` fixture conflict (VERIFIED-LOCAL, R1, #304)

The test asserts the **cert-LOADING depth**: `ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain` on a real cert/key —
a malformed PEM raises `ssl.SSLError`. This is strictly DEEPER than Hermes' own tests, which only
use a NON-EXISTENT `/fake/ca.pem` path and assert context creation, never calling `load_cert_chain`.

Both R0 cert-sourcing options are now **VERIFIED CLOSED**:

1. Generate at test time via `cryptography` — **CONFIRMED ABSENT**: `pixi run python -c "import
   cryptography"` AND `import trustme` BOTH raise `ModuleNotFoundError` in the Telemachy env (deps
   are only pydantic, pydantic-settings, nats-py, pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov). So a
   `cryptography`/`trustme` test fails to import.
2. Commit a static throwaway PEM pair under `tests/fixtures/` — **CONFIRMED BLOCKED**:
   `provisioning/ProjectTelemachy/.gitignore:21-22` = `*.key`/`*.pem` and root `.gitignore:7-9` =
   `*.key`/`*.pem`/`*.crt`, so a checked-in PEM fixture is silently git-ignored.

**SOLUTION THAT WORKS (VERIFIED-LOCAL, R1):** the `openssl` binary IS on PATH inside pixi (OpenSSL
3.6.2). Generate the cert/key at test time into pytest's `tmp_path` (ephemeral, never committed →
`.gitignore` is moot):

```python
import subprocess

def test_build_ssl_context_loads_real_cert(tmp_path):
    cert, key = tmp_path / "c.pem", tmp_path / "k.pem"
    subprocess.run(["openssl", "req", "-x509", "-newkey", "rsa:2048", "-nodes",
                    "-keyout", str(key), "-out", str(cert), "-days", "1",
                    "-subj", "/CN=telemachy-test"], check=True)
    # build_ssl_context runs load_cert_chain → raises ssl.SSLError on a malformed cert.
    build_ssl_context(str(cert), str(cert), str(key))
```

LESSON: when a repo ignores `*.pem`/`*.key` and ships no cert lib, generate certs at runtime via the
`openssl` binary into `tmp_path` rather than committing fixtures or adding a `cryptography` dep.

### Non-existent referenced artifacts (do NOT fabricate) (VERIFIED-LOCAL, R1, #304)

```bash
ls docs/adr/                      # shows 001–008 ONLY — 009 is ABSENT; 008 is the NATS TLS ADR
ls docs/runbooks/                 # enable-nats-auth.md is ABSENT
```

- **ADR-009 does NOT exist; ADR-008 is the real TLS ADR.** `ls docs/adr/` shows 001–008 only, and
  008 is `008-nats-tls-encryption…`. Issue #304 cites
  `docs/adr/009-nats-authentication-authorization.md` (and `docs/runbooks/enable-nats-auth.md`) as
  if present — BOTH are absent. Either ADR-009 lands in a sibling PR (issue #175 / parent) or the
  plan must stop asserting it as present and point docs at ADR-008, which actually exists. Do NOT
  fabricate ADR-009. LESSON: an issue body can reference a sibling-PR artifact (ADR-009 from #175)
  that has not landed; verify `ls docs/adr docs/runbooks` before citing or linking it.
- **`docs/runbooks/enable-nats-auth.md` does NOT exist** (present: add-new-agent-type, add-new-host,
  branch-protection-rollout, disaster-recovery, no-silent-failures, wsl2-podman-setup). The issue
  says Telemachy is "documented in" it as if it exists; the plan CREATES it. **REVIEWER RISK:** if a
  Hermes/#175 PR also creates this same runbook, two PRs collide on the same new file — confirm
  ownership of `enable-nats-auth.md` before creating it.

### After NATS Restart

Agamemnon and Nestor do NOT auto-reconnect after NATS restarts. Always kill and restart them:

```bash
pkill -f ProjectAgamemnon_server || kill $(pgrep -f ProjectAgamemnon_server)
pkill -f ProjectNestor_server    || kill $(pgrep -f ProjectNestor_server)
```

| `wget -qO-` in nats:alpine | Combined short flag with BusyBox wget | BusyBox wget rejects `-qO-`; prints usage and exits 1 | Use `-q -O /dev/stdout` (space-separated, explicit path) |
| Sleeping after final retry attempt | `if attempt < retries` guard | Adds unnecessary latency after retries exhausted | Guard with `if attempt < retries - 1` |
| Catching bare `Exception` in retry | Catch-all in retry loop | Hides non-retryable bugs as transient failures; burns retry budget | Only catch explicit `_RETRYABLE_PUBLISH_ERRORS` tuple |
| No restart after NATS port change | Left Agamemnon/Hermes running | Processes lose NATS connection and do not auto-reconnect | Restart both services after NATS is stable |
| Assuming Odysseus present on all hosts | Skipped `gh repo clone` step | Only some hosts had a clone; others needed fresh clone | Pre-check `ls ~/<project-root>` — clone if missing |
| `podman cp` to overwrite read-only bind-mount | Tried `podman cp` on `:ro` Prometheus config | Volume is `:ro` — copy fails with "device or resource busy" | Write resolved-IP config to host bind-mount source, then `/-/reload` |
| Forking Atlas branch from feature branch | Created feat branch from `feat/issue-22-ci-hardening` | Picked up 12 extra CI commits; PR not rebased to main | Always fork from `main`; check base before `git worktree add` |
| Leaf remote on port 4222 (auth fix) | Pointing `remotes.url` at the client port while adding creds | Leaf nodes silently never connect | Leaf remotes MUST use 7422, even when adding auth |
| Auth only on client listener | Adding `authorization{}` only at the top level of `server.conf` | The `leafnodes{}` listener stays open — anonymous leaf relay still works | The leafnode listener needs its OWN `authorization` block |
| `sensitive = true` in Nomad var | Terraform-ism to hide NATS creds in a Nomad variable | Nomad parse error: "argument named 'sensitive' is not expected" | Don't secure NATS creds via Nomad `sensitive` vars |
| Naive grep gate | `grep` for `token` without stripping comments | A commented-out example passes the check (false-negative) | Strip comments before asserting presence; assert per-block, not file-wide |
| Assuming pytest exists | Planning a pytest-based regression test for the config | Odysseus has no pytest; tasks are `just`-backed | Wire gates into the existing `just` / CI runner |
| awk parser that ends block on first `}` | Validate leafnodes auth by scanning until the first `}` | Nested `tls{}` inside `leafnodes{}` closes first — parser declared a CORRECTLY-authed config unauthenticated; exited 1 on BOTH fixed and broken configs | A config-block validator MUST track brace DEPTH (count `{` vs `}`), not stop at the first `}`. Nested blocks are the norm in NATS/HCL-style configs |
| Verification that only checks the broken case | `git stash && ! validator && echo PASS` | A validator that always exits 1 "passes" this check for the wrong reason — masks that it also rejects the FIX | Always assert BOTH directions: exit 1 on the unfixed config AND exit 0 on the fixed config. A regression gate that can't accept the fix is broken |
| Assuming a recipe wired into justfile runs in CI | Claimed validator "already runs on pull_request via ci.yml" | `ci.yml`'s validate job inlines its own steps and never invokes `just validate-configs`/`pixi run validate` | Don't assume CI calls your `just` recipe — READ the workflow. Add an explicit CI step (or confirm the recipe is invoked) or the gate doesn't exist |
| Parse check gated on `command -v nats-server` | `command -v nats-server && nats-server -t ... \|\| echo skipped` | The tool is absent in CI, so the check silently skips — the fail-closed assumption is never actually tested | If a verification matters, INSTALL the tool in CI (pinned release) and run it unconditionally; a `command -v ... \|\|` guard turns the check into a no-op |
| Asserting `.gitignore` coverage from a pattern | Claimed `/etc/nats/certs/` was already git-ignored | `grep -n "certs\|creds\|nats" .gitignore` → no matches; the claim was fabricated from the certs convention | Grep the actual file before claiming a path is ignored. "It follows the convention" is not evidence the entry exists |
| `wget` healthcheck against a distroless app image | Used `["CMD","wget","-qO-","http://localhost:PORT/healthz"]` (matching sibling services that use slim/alpine images) on a service whose runtime is `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` | Distroless `static` images have NO shell, wget, busybox, or any external tool — the healthcheck command does not exist in the container, so it fails permanently and the container never reports `healthy` | A wget/curl/sh healthcheck is unusable on a distroless runtime. Use a binary self-probe `["CMD","/<binary>","-healthcheck"]`; the app binary must expose a healthcheck flag that does a localhost GET and exits 0/1. Compose healthchecks always run INSIDE the container — there is no shell-free external option |
| Trusting `docker compose config` as proof the healthcheck works | Plan's verification ran `docker compose config` and passed, treated as evidence the service would be healthy | `docker compose config` only validates STRUCTURE/syntax — it never executes the healthcheck command, so a healthcheck pointing at a nonexistent binary (wget in distroless) passes config but fails at runtime | Structural compose validation is NOT runtime validation. For a healthcheck on a distroless image, separately assert the probe does not shell out to wget/sh AND (post-build) assert the container actually reaches `healthy` |
| "matches every existing service" reasoning for healthcheck form | Justified the wget array healthcheck because 4 sibling services use the identical form | The siblings run slim/alpine images (wget present); the new service runs distroless (wget absent) — the convention does not transfer across base-image families | Convention-matching is only valid when the BASE IMAGE family matches. Check the target service's runtime image before copying a sibling's healthcheck |
| Downgrade Grafana anon to Viewer instead of disabling | Kept `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED` on and set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Viewer` | Issue #206 asks to DISABLE anonymous access, not downgrade the anonymous role — anonymous read access still exists | To disable anonymous access set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED: "false"`; downgrading the org role still leaves anonymous access open |
| Left `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE` after disabling anon | Set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false` but kept the org-role var | Once anonymous is off the role var is dead config; it misleads a reviewer into thinking anonymous is only downgraded | REMOVE `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE` when disabling anonymous — it has no effect and obscures intent |
| Disabling Grafana anon without an admin credential | Set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false` with no `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_*` | With anon off Grafana falls back to the login screen; no usable credential means a locked-out e2e stack | Supply env-overridable admin creds (`${GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER:-admin}`/`${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}`) so the one-command e2e stack still logs in |
| Assuming `compose config` proves the Grafana health probe still works | Ran `compose config` (syntax OK) and treated it as proof `:3001/api/health` survives anon disable | `compose config` validates structure only — it never starts Grafana or curls health; the `/api/health`-unaffected claim is untested | Structural compose validation is NOT runtime validation. Actually `up -d grafana` + curl `/api/health` (expect `database=ok`) before claiming probes survive |
| Asserting configs are credential-less from the #176-era skill | Planned #208 assuming `configs/nats/*.conf` still ship with no TLS/auth | ADR-008 already added full TLS (`tls{}`, leafnodes port 7422 + tls, cluster tls, `/etc/nats/certs/`) to both configs | Re-read the canonical configs each session; a documented security gap may already be closed by a later ADR/PR |
| Writing `step ca ...` flags from memory | Plan used `step ca init/certificate/root/revoke` with specific flags, unrun | `step` subcommand flags vary by version and were never executed | Treat external CLI syntax as unverified; install/run the tool or mark every flag reviewer-must-verify |
| Claiming SIGHUP gives zero-downtime cert rotation | `kill -HUP <nats pid>` asserted to hot-reload TLS certs without JetStream loss | Reload-reads-certs-in-place behavior not exercised for the running NATS version | Tie any "zero-downtime" claim to a verified reload signal; if certs need a restart, dependent services (Agamemnon/Nestor) need manual restart too |
| Editing an append-only ADR for a back-link | Plan proposed adding a References line to ADR-008 | CLAUDE.md principle 3: ADRs are append-only / never edited once accepted | Link one-directionally (runbook→ADR); satisfy discoverability via the docs/README index row, not by editing the ADR |
| Trusting docs/README runbook table as complete | Used the README table as the runbook inventory | Table already omits `branch-protection-rollout.md` and `no-silent-failures.md` | The hand-maintained README table drifts; enumerate runbooks with `ls docs/runbooks/`, not the index |
| Trusting `/varz` `tls_required` field name from memory | Plan greps `curl :8222/varz \| ... d.get('tls_required')` to confirm TLS-on-client | The exact JSON key for "TLS required on client port" in the running NATS monitoring API was not confirmed | Don't assert monitoring-API JSON key names from memory; curl `/varz` against the running version and read the actual keys |
| Assuming Telemachy has a live `nats.connect()` to wire mTLS into | Planned to modify Telemachy's NATS client connection per issue #304 | `grep -rn "nats.connect\|import nats\|from nats" provisioning/ProjectTelemachy/src` returns NOTHING; `_monitor_completion` (executor.py:265-300) HTTP-polls Agamemnon, it is not a NATS subscriber | There is no connection site to modify. Satisfy "wire into the NATS client" at the CONFIG layer (`build_ssl_context()` + `nats_connect_kwargs()` helpers a future connection consumes), mirroring Hermes; grep for the connect call before assuming it exists |
| Asserting nats-py `tls=` kwarg "exactly as Hermes does" without verifying | Plan used `nats.connect(url, tls=ssl_ctx, tls_hostname=...)` claiming Hermes consumes `build_ssl_context()` at its connect site | Hermes `publisher.py:91 nats.connect(...)` was seen but the TLS-arg wiring was NEVER grepped; `build_ssl_context()` exists in Hermes config but its call site passing the context was not confirmed | Verify the exact nats-py kwarg (`tls` vs `tls_handshake_first`/`tls_hostname`) against the installed version AND confirm Hermes actually passes the context at a connect site before claiming "exactly as Hermes does" |
| Referencing ADR-009 as the governing decision | Issue #304 cites ADR-009; plan's runbook header links to it | `ls docs/adr \| grep 009` is empty — only 001-007 exist (008 referenced as "Proposed"); ADR-009 does NOT exist in the repo | Do NOT fabricate ADR-009. Either it lands in a sibling PR (#175/parent) or stop asserting it as present; verify ADR existence with `ls docs/adr` before citing |
| Assuming `docs/runbooks/enable-nats-auth.md` exists | Issue says Telemachy is "documented in enable-nats-auth.md (step 3)" as if present | `ls docs/runbooks/` shows it is ABSENT (present: add-new-agent-type, add-new-host, branch-protection-rollout, disaster-recovery, no-silent-failures, wsl2-podman-setup) | The plan CREATES the runbook; confirm ownership first — a Hermes/#175 PR may also create the same new file and collide. Enumerate runbooks with `ls docs/runbooks/`, never trust the issue body |
| Assuming `cryptography` is in Telemachy's pixi env for a test cert | Test plan generates a self-signed cert/key via `cryptography` "already transitively present" | `pixi.toml` lists pydantic, pydantic-settings, nats-py, pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov — `cryptography` was NOT seen as a direct dep | Don't assume a transitive dep is importable in tests; prefer a checked-in static throwaway PEM pair under `tests/fixtures/` (no runtime dep), or confirm `cryptography` is declared |
| Committing a test PEM fixture without checking `.gitignore` | Plan to commit a throwaway cert/key pair under `tests/fixtures/` | The team skill notes `.gitignore` covers `*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.crt`/`secrets/`/`*.secret` — which would BLOCK committing the fixture | A `.gitignore` that ignores cert keys conflicts with a checked-in test fixture; resolve with a scoped negation (`!tests/fixtures/*.pem`) and confirm the file is actually staged before relying on it |
| (R1, #304) Assumed Hermes passes `tls=` at its connect site | Planned to "wire it exactly as Hermes does", claiming Hermes consumes `build_ssl_context()` in its `nats.connect()` | VERIFIED: `grep -rn "tls=\|build_ssl_context\|ssl_context" infrastructure/ProjectHermes/src/` returns ONLY the method DEFINITION at `config.py:126`; `publisher.py:91-97` calls `nats.connect(...)` with NO `tls=` kwarg — Hermes has the SAME latent gap | Grep the actual call site before asserting a reference impl "already does X"; a defined-but-unused helper is a trap — there is no Hermes connect site to mirror |
| (R1, #304) Planned a checked-in PEM test fixture | Tried to source the test cert/key from a committed `tests/fixtures/*.pem` pair | VERIFIED: Telemachy `.gitignore:21-22` (`*.key`/`*.pem`) + root `.gitignore:7-9` (`*.key`/`*.pem`/`*.crt`) silently exclude it; AND `cryptography`/`trustme` BOTH `ModuleNotFoundError` in the pixi env | Generate the cert/key at test time with the `openssl` binary (on PATH, 3.6.2) into pytest `tmp_path` (ephemeral → `.gitignore` is moot); don't commit fixtures or add a `cryptography` dep |
| (R1, #304) Inspected `nats.connect` wrapper signature for `tls=` | `inspect.signature(nats.connect)` to confirm the mTLS kwargs | The module-level `nats.connect` wrapper does NOT expose those params (nor `__version__`); the params live on `nats.aio.client.Client.connect` | Inspect `nats.aio.client.Client.connect` — `tls`/`tls_hostname`/`tls_handshake_first` are confirmed there on nats-py 2.14.0, not on the wrapper |
| (R1, #304) Cited ADR-009 as the governing TLS decision | Linked docs at `docs/adr/009-nats-authentication-authorization.md` per the issue body | VERIFIED: `ls docs/adr/` shows 001–008 ONLY; 009 is ABSENT and `008-nats-tls-encryption…` is the real TLS ADR; `docs/runbooks/enable-nats-auth.md` also absent | Verify `ls docs/adr docs/runbooks` before citing; point docs at ADR-008 (which exists), not the unlanded sibling-PR ADR-009 |
| (R1, #304) Shipped an unconsumed `nats_connect_kwargs()` helper for AC1 | Returned a kwargs dict a hypothetical future `nats.connect()` caller would use, to satisfy "Telemachy connects to NATS" | A config builder nobody calls is YAGNI and does NOT make Telemachy connect; Telemachy has NO `nats.connect()` anywhere | Add the minimal REAL consumer — `connect_nats()` invoked from the CLI `run` path as a `tls://` preflight — not a helper for a hypothetical caller |
| (R2, #304) Adding a second `asyncio.run` (or import-time block) for the `tls://` preflight | Wanted to run the async `connect_nats()` preflight from the Typer `run` command, so reached for a fresh `asyncio.run(preflight())` (or a module-level block) | The `run` command (`cli.py:120`) ALREADY drives async via `_run_with_signals()` (`cli.py:141`); a second `asyncio.run` nests event loops (`RuntimeError`) and an import-time block runs before the command is even invoked | Insert the preflight INSIDE the existing `_run_with_signals()` wrapper — after the signal handlers, before the `async with AgamemnonClient(...)` at `cli.py:178`; reuse the existing loop, never open a second one |

### Uncertain Assumptions a Reviewer MUST Verify (NATS auth plan, issue #176)

This is the core value of the planning learning. A plan for NATS leaf/server auth in this
ecosystem is only as trustworthy as these unverified claims. A reviewer should treat each as
a blocking question, not a settled fact.

1. **Env-var substitution in `authorization { token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN" }` — fail-closed is now
   TESTED, not assumed (R1 downgrade).** Previously the HIGHEST-RISK untested assumption; R1 adds a
   pinned `nats-server -t -c server.conf` run with the var UNSET that greps the rendered config for
   the leaked literal `$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN`. With that CI step the fail-closed behavior is verified, not
   hoped for. The residual risk is keeping that pinned check unconditional (never gate it on
   `command -v nats-server`) so it can't silently skip.
2. **Whether one shared token across client + all leaf nodes is acceptable** vs per-leaf
   `.creds`. A shared token is a shared secret with no per-leaf revocation. The plan documents
   `.creds` as recommended but ships a token fallback; the reviewer must confirm the bootstrap
   token is not silently becoming the permanent posture.
3. **The awk leafnode-block parser brittleness is RESOLVED in R1 by the brace-depth validator.**
   The original NOGO cause: a parser that ends the block on the first `}` closes the nested
   `tls {}`, not `leafnodes {}`, mis-declaring auth. R1 replaces it with the depth-tracking
   `block()` helper (counts `{` vs `}`, strips comments) prototyped this session — exit 0 on the
   fixed fixture, exit 1 on the current configs. Reviewer residual: confirm the validator is run in
   BOTH directions (rejects the bad config AND accepts the fix), never just the bad case.
4. **Cited line numbers may have drifted.** `server.conf:27-34`, `leaf.conf:34-37`,
   `justfile:258-266`, `ci.yml:11-55`, `deployment.md:152-161` were read once. Re-confirm each
   before editing.
5. **ADR-008 Status is "Proposed", not "Accepted".** The plan builds ADR-009 on top of an
   unaccepted ADR. Confirm the sequencing/numbering is still valid.
6. **`.gitignore` coverage of `.creds`/`certs` was FABRICATED in R0 — confirmed absent in R1.**
   `grep -n "certs\|creds\|nats" .gitignore` returns no matches; the R0 claim that the convention
   already ignored these paths was invented. The plan must ADD the `.gitignore` entries, not assume
   them. Lesson: grep the actual file before claiming a path is ignored.
7. **`just validate-configs` running in CI on `pull_request` was FALSE — confirmed in R1.**
   `ci.yml`'s validate job inlines its own steps and never invokes `just validate-configs` /
   `pixi run validate`. The gate does not exist until an explicit CI step is added (or the workflow
   is changed to call the recipe). Read `ci.yml` end-to-end; do not infer the invocation graph.
8. **Shared-token-vs-per-leaf-`.creds` posture risk REMAINS (R1, unresolved).** The plan still
   ships a `token` bootstrap fallback alongside the recommended per-leaf `.creds`. A shared token is
   a shared secret with no per-leaf revocation; the reviewer must confirm the bootstrap token is not
   silently becoming the permanent posture. This is the one reviewer-risk item the R1 prototype did
   NOT retire.

### Reviewer-risk + Meta-Lessons (planning learnings from the NOGO, R1)

These are the durable PLANNING lessons the NOGO cycle taught — independent of NATS specifics.

- **The single most valuable planning move was PROTOTYPING the validator before shipping the
  plan.** Running the brace-depth `block()` extractor against fixed + current fixtures turned "I
  think this works" into "exit 0 vs exit 1, verified." Plans that ship unvalidated shell/awk get
  NOGO'd on latent traps (here: the nested-`tls{}` brace).
- **Verify the CI invocation graph, not just file existence.** A gate wired into a `just` recipe is
  invisible to CI unless the workflow actually calls that recipe. Read `ci.yml` end-to-end.
- **Every line-number citation drifts.** The NOGO flagged `:27-39` vs the actual `:27-40`. Re-grep
  before citing; precision claims invite precision checks.
- **Fail-closed must be TESTED, not asserted.** The highest-risk assumption (unset
  `$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN` resolves empty, not to the literal string) only became believable once a pinned
  `nats-server -t` run was added that greps the rendered config for a leaked literal.
- **Negative-path verification needs BOTH directions.** Asserting only "rejects the bad config"
  hides a validator that rejects everything — including the fix. Assert exit 1 on broken AND exit 0
  on fixed.

**Distroless healthcheck planning lessons (R2, issue #154 — unverified, plan only):**

- **Before copying a sibling service's healthcheck, check the TARGET service's runtime base image.**
  wget/curl/sh healthchecks silently break on distroless (`gcr.io/distroless/static-*` has no
  shell/wget/busybox); the convention only transfers within the same base-image family.
- **`docker compose config` passing is NOT evidence a healthcheck works** — it validates structure,
  never executes the probe. A plan whose only health verification is `compose config` can be green
  while the acceptance criterion ("shows healthy") fails at runtime. Separately assert the container
  actually reaches `healthy` post-build.
- **When the healthcheck binary/flag is owned by a DIFFERENT issue than the compose wiring, the
  self-probe introduces a cross-issue coordination dependency** — name the `-healthcheck` flag
  explicitly as a blocking note, never assume it exists.
- **An issue body's verbatim YAML/code block is a desired end-state, not a guaranteed-correct
  literal** — it may encode a healthcheck that cannot run against the chosen runtime image. Re-derive
  correctness from the actual base image, don't copy blindly. (This generalizes the prior "issue
  snippet ≠ literal diff" lesson already in the skill from the duplicate-recipe learning.)

### Uncertain Assumptions a Reviewer MUST Verify (Grafana anon-access plan, issue #206 — unverified)

No container was run this session; these are blocking questions, not settled facts.

1. **HIGHEST RISK — `/api/health` is unauthenticated regardless of anon settings.** The plan claims
   disabling `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED` does NOT break the e2e health probes (`e2e/run-hello-world.sh`,
   `run-crosshost-e2e.sh`, `run-hermes-hub-e2e.sh`, `e2e/doctor.sh` all curl `:3001/api/health`). This
   was asserted from Grafana docs knowledge, NOT verified. Confirm at runtime that `/api/health` still
   returns `database=ok` with anon disabled. If false, every health-check-gated e2e phase fails.
2. **Provisioning survives login-required mode.** Dashboards/datasources are assumed file-provisioned
   via read-only `/etc/grafana/provisioning` mounts that do not depend on the anonymous API. Confirm
   provisioning still loads after login is required.
3. **`admin/admin` default posture.** Env-overridable defaults keep the e2e stack one-command, but the
   bootstrap default can silently become the permanent posture (same shape as the NATS shared-token
   risk). Name the trade-off so a reviewer can object.
4. **Scope boundary is correct.** Only `docker-compose.e2e.yml` at the Odysseus root changes. Confirm
   no other CANONICAL root compose file re-enables anonymous Grafana, that the overlays
   (`docker-compose.crosshost.yml`, `e2e/docker-compose.*.yml`) define no grafana service, and that
   ProjectArgus/ProjectKeystone (separate submodules) are correctly out of scope.
5. **`compose config` ≠ runtime proof.** Structural validation passing proves syntax only — it never
   starts Grafana or probes health. The health-probe-still-green claim needs an actual `up -d grafana`
   + curl, not config validation.
6. **Cited line numbers may have drifted.** `docker-compose.e2e.yml:154-155`, `:153-159`, `:160-162`,
   sibling `provisioning/ProjectKeystone/k8s/grafana.yaml:95,100-101`, `docs/e2e-walkthrough-report.md:290`
   were read once. Re-grep before editing.

### Uncertain Assumptions a Reviewer MUST Verify (NATS TLS security runbook, issue #208 — unverified)

No commands were run this session; these are blocking questions, not settled facts.

1. **THE CONFIGS CHANGED — re-read them (single most important correction).** The #176-era
   premise that `configs/nats/*.conf` ship with NO TLS is STALE. ADR-008 (Status: Proposed) is
   already merged: both `server.conf` and `leaf.conf` now carry top-level `tls {}`,
   `leafnodes { port=7422; tls{} }`, and cluster TLS referencing
   `/etc/nats/certs/{server-cert.pem,server-key.pem,ca.pem}`; leaf.conf's remote is now
   `nats+tls://<ip>:7422`. LESSON: re-read the canonical configs each session before asserting
   their security posture; a documented gap may already be closed by a later ADR/PR.
2. **`step` CLI command syntax was NOT verified.** `step ca init --name ... --dns ... --address :443
   --provisioner admin`, `step ca certificate <name> cert key --san <ip>`, `step ca root ca.pem`,
   and `step ca revoke --cert ...` were written from memory. `step ca init` flags in particular
   vary across versions — confirm against the installed `step` version.
3. **NATS SIGHUP cert reload was NOT verified.** The plan claims `kill -HUP <nats pid>` reloads TLS
   certs without dropping JetStream state. NATS supports config reload on SIGHUP, but whether it
   re-reads cert files in-place (vs requiring a full restart) for the running version was not
   exercised. If SIGHUP does not re-read certs, Scenario 2's "zero-downtime" claim inverts into a
   downtime + manual-restart procedure (and Agamemnon/Nestor must be restarted too).
4. **`/varz` `tls_required` field name unverified.** The exact JSON key for "TLS required on client
   port" in the running NATS monitoring API was not confirmed. Curl `/varz` and read the actual keys.
5. **ADR-008 Status is "Proposed", not "Accepted".** The plan operationalizes a Proposed ADR and
   treats its cert-path convention (`/etc/nats/certs/...`), permissions (key 600 / cert+ca 644), and
   three provisioning strategies as settled. Confirm ADR-008 is still the source of truth and has not
   been superseded.
6. **Append-only-ADR tension.** The plan's optional back-reference line into ADR-008's References
   conflicts with CLAUDE.md principle 3 (ADRs append-only / never edited). Drop it; link
   one-directionally (runbook → ADR); satisfy discoverability via the `docs/README.md` index row.
7. **Runbook-index drift observed (correct-discipline lesson).** `docs/README.md`'s runbook table
   (lines ~35-41) is MISSING existing runbooks `branch-protection-rollout.md` and
   `no-silent-failures.md`. Enumerate runbooks with `ls docs/runbooks/`, not the index table.
8. **`.gitignore` cert-key coverage — VERIFIED this time (contrast with #176's fabrication).** The
   claim that `*.pem`, `.env*`, `*.secret`, `secrets/` are git-ignored was actually grepped and is
   TRUE (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.crt`, `.env`, `.env*.local`, `secrets/`, `*.secret` all present). This
   is the correct discipline (grep the actual file) — directly reinforcing the #176 lesson that the
   earlier `.gitignore` claim was fabricated.

### Reviewer-risk + Meta-Lessons (NATS TLS runbook planning, issue #208 — unverified)

Durable PLANNING lessons that generalize beyond NATS:

- **A skill premise of the form "X has no security config" has a SHELF LIFE.** Security gaps get
  closed by other issues/ADRs between sessions. Verify the current file state before building a plan
  on top of a documented gap — here, ADR-008 had already added TLS the #176-era skill said was absent.
- **External CLI command syntax written from memory is an unverified-assumption CLASS.** `step`,
  `nats-server` flags, and monitoring-API JSON keys must each be flagged reviewer-must-verify, never
  presented as fact. Install/run the tool or mark every flag uncertain.
- **A "zero-downtime rotation" claim hinges on whether the daemon HOT-RELOADS certs.** If it does
  not, the claim inverts into a downtime + manual-restart procedure. Always tie the reload mechanism
  to a verified signal/behavior before claiming zero downtime.

### Reviewer Verification Status (Telemachy NATS client-cert mTLS, issue #304 — R1, most items now VERIFIED-LOCAL)

R1 (post-NOGO) converted most of the R0 reviewer-risks into verified-local facts. Only items 1 and 4
remain genuine reviewer questions; the rest are now settled-this-session.

1. **STILL A REVIEWER QUESTION — config-layer wiring vs a live connection (acceptance criterion).**
   Telemachy has NO `nats.connect()` (VERIFIED: grep returns nothing; `_monitor_completion`
   HTTP-polls Agamemnon). A config-builder ALONE cannot satisfy AC1 "Telemachy connects to a NATS
   server with verify_and_map=true". The R1 honest fix ADDS a minimal REAL consumer —
   `connect_nats()` invoked from the CLI `run` path as a `tls://` preflight handshake — rather than
   shipping an unconsumed `nats_connect_kwargs()` helper (YAGNI, flagged in the NOGO). **R2 UPDATE:
   the R1 plan PASSED review (no new NOGO)** — the preflight-handshake consumer was ACCEPTED as the
   intended scope, and the insertion point is now CONFIRMED: inside the existing `_run_with_signals()`
   wrapper (`cli.py:141`, used by `run` at `:120`), after the signal handlers and before the
   `async with AgamemnonClient(...)` block (`cli.py:178`). No second `asyncio.run`.
2. **nats-py connect kwargs — VERIFIED-LOCAL (R1, #304).** On **nats-py 2.14.0**
   (`importlib.metadata.version('nats-py')`), `inspect.signature(nats.aio.client.Client.connect)`
   confirms `tls`, `tls_hostname`, AND `tls_handshake_first` are real parameters, so
   `nats.connect(url, tls=ctx, tls_hostname=host)` is correct. CAVEAT: inspect
   `nats.aio.client.Client.connect`, NOT the module-level `nats.connect` wrapper (which exposes
   neither these params nor `__version__`). The "exactly as Hermes does" analogy is FALSE-CONFIRMED:
   Hermes does NOT pass `tls=` at its connect site (`publisher.py:91-97`), only DEFINES
   `build_ssl_context()` at `config.py:126`.
3. **ADR-009 does NOT exist — VERIFIED-LOCAL (R1, #304).** `ls docs/adr/` shows 001–008 only; 008 is
   the NATS TLS encryption ADR. The issue cites `009-nats-authentication-authorization.md` as
   governing — it is absent. Point docs at ADR-008 (which exists); do NOT fabricate ADR-009 (may land
   via #175/parent).
4. **STILL A REVIEWER QUESTION — `docs/runbooks/enable-nats-auth.md` does NOT exist (VERIFIED absent,
   R1).** The issue references it as if present; the plan would CREATE it. If a Hermes/#175 PR also
   creates the same new file, the two PRs collide — confirm ownership of `enable-nats-auth.md` before
   creating it.
5. **Test-cert sourcing — VERIFIED-LOCAL (R1, #304).** `cryptography` AND `trustme` BOTH
   `ModuleNotFoundError` in the Telemachy pixi env, and the `.gitignore` (`*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.crt` at
   both root `:7-9` and Telemachy `:21-22`) BLOCKS a committed fixture. CONFIRMED solution: generate
   the cert/key with the `openssl` binary (on PATH, OpenSSL 3.6.2) into pytest `tmp_path`; the test
   then exercises `load_cert_chain` (raises `ssl.SSLError` on a malformed cert) — strictly deeper than
   Hermes' `test_tls_config.py`, which uses a NON-EXISTENT `/fake/ca.pem` and never loads a chain.
6. **Hermes/Telemachy line-number citations may have drifted.** `config.py:126`, `publisher.py:91-97`,
   Telemachy `executor.py:265-300`, the two `.gitignore` ranges — all read once this session. Re-grep
   before editing; precision claims invite precision checks.

| Odysseus | Plan for issue #176 (NATS leaf auth) | unverified plan — no code run, no CI; value is the reviewer-risk catalogue of uncertain assumptions |
| Odysseus | Plan R1 for issue #176 (NATS leaf auth, post-NOGO) | validator prototyped verified-local (brace-depth `block()`: exit 0 on fixed fixture, exit 1 on current configs); full plan still unverified |
| Odysseus | Plan R2 for issue #154 (Argus distroless dashboard healthcheck, post-NOGO) | unverified planning learning — distroless `static` images have no shell/wget; use binary self-probe `["CMD","/<binary>","-healthcheck"]`; `docker compose config` validates structure only. No container built or observed healthy |
| Odysseus | Plan for issue #206 (Grafana anonymous-access hardening, docker-compose.e2e.yml) | unverified planning learning — disable `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED`, remove dead `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE`, add env-overridable admin creds. Load-bearing untested assumption: `/api/health` stays unauthenticated with anon off so e2e probes survive. No container run |
| Odysseus | Plan for issue #208 (NATS TLS security runbook — cert provisioning, rotation, compromise) | unverified planning learning — adds `docs/runbooks/nats-security.md` + README row. KEY correction: ADR-008 already added TLS to the configs (the #176-era "credential-less" premise is stale). `step` flags, SIGHUP cert hot-reload, and `/varz` `tls_required` key all written from memory (reviewer-must-verify). `.gitignore` cert-key coverage VERIFIED grepped. No commands run |
| ProjectTelemachy | Plan for issue #304 (NATS client-cert mTLS wiring) | unverified planning learning — LOAD-BEARING FINDING: Telemachy has NO live `nats.connect()` (`_monitor_completion` HTTP-polls Agamemnon), so the plan wires mTLS at the CONFIG layer (`build_ssl_context()` + `nats_connect_kwargs()`, mirroring Hermes) and proves only the client-cert LOADING path. nats-py `tls=` kwarg + Hermes' connect-site consumption assumed-by-analogy (unverified). ADR-009 and `docs/runbooks/enable-nats-auth.md` both cited by the issue but do NOT exist in the repo. `cryptography` test-dep unverified; committing a PEM fixture conflicts with `.gitignore`. No code run |
| ProjectTelemachy | Plan R1 for issue #304 (NATS client-cert mTLS, post-NOGO) | R1 VERIFIED-LOCAL (no CI): Hermes `build_ssl_context()` is DEFINED-BUT-UNUSED (`config.py:126`); `publisher.py:91-97 nats.connect(...)` passes NO `tls=` — the "exactly as Hermes does" analogy mirrors a connect site that does not exist. nats-py **2.14.0** `nats.aio.client.Client.connect` confirmed to accept `tls`/`tls_hostname`/`tls_handshake_first` (inspect `Client.connect`, NOT the `nats.connect` wrapper). `cryptography`+`trustme` both ModuleNotFoundError and `.gitignore` blocks `*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.crt` → generate certs via the `openssl` binary (3.6.2) into pytest `tmp_path`. ADR-009 absent (`ls docs/adr/` -> 001-008; 008 IS the TLS ADR); `enable-nats-auth.md` absent. AC1 needs a real consumed `connect_nats()` (`tls://` preflight), NOT an unconsumed helper (YAGNI). Stacks on #2717's v1.6.0 |
| ProjectTelemachy | Plan R2 for issue #304 (NATS client-cert mTLS, plan APPROVED) | R2 (PATCH, no CI): the R1 plan PASSED review — no new NOGO; preflight-handshake scope ACCEPTED. CONFIRMED insertion point (verified-local): the `tls://` preflight goes INSIDE the existing `_run_with_signals()` async wrapper (`cli.py:141`, used by the `run` command at `:120` with SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers + a Rich `Progress` context), after the signal handlers and BEFORE the `async with AgamemnonClient(...)` block (`cli.py:178`); do NOT add a second `asyncio.run` or block at import time.
