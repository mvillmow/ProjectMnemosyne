# HomericIntelligence Cross-Host Deployment and Mesh Topology

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-06-20 |
| **Objective** | Deploy and operate the HomericIntelligence mesh across multiple Tailscale hosts using NATS JetStream, compose overlays, justfile launchers, and resilient publish patterns; and plan credential-based authentication for the credential-less NATS leaf/server config |
| **Outcome** | Deployment patterns verified-local (two-host + 6-host). The NATS leaf/server auth fix is still an UNVERIFIED PLAN for issue #176 (R1, post-NOGO) — the full plan was not run end-to-end and no CI passed. BUT the config-block-presence validator was PROTOTYPED this session (verified-local: exit 0 on the fixed fixture, exit 1 on the repo's current configs). The Grafana anonymous-access hardening (issue #206) is an UNVERIFIED PLAN — no container was run; the load-bearing untested assumption is that Grafana's `/api/health` stays unauthenticated when anonymous access is disabled (so e2e health probes survive). The plan's highest-value content remains its catalogue of uncertain assumptions a reviewer must verify, now sharpened by concrete NOGO causes. |
| **Verification** | unverified OVERALL for the NATS auth-planning section (the full plan was not exercised end-to-end); the brace-depth config-block validator specifically is verified-local (prototyped 2026-06-19 against fixed + current fixtures). The Grafana anonymous-access hardening subsection is unverified (no container run; `/api/health`-unaffected claim untested). Verified-local for all prior deployment content (Odysseus sessions 2026-04-03 to 2026-05-03). |

## When to Use

- Splitting the HomericIntelligence E2E compose stack across multiple physical machines
- Configuring NATS connections (direct or leafnode) over Tailscale mesh networking
- Bringing up Agamemnon, Nestor, or Hermes natively (binary/uvicorn) or via podman on any Tailnet host from cold state
- Launching myrmidon Python workers across Tailnet hosts (fan-out or hub+remote-worker pattern)
- Adding justfile recipes that launch C++ binaries or delegate to submodule justfiles
- Choosing between compose overlay vs native binary vs per-component launcher deployment
- Implementing NATS JetStream publish retry with exponential backoff and jitter in Python
- Debugging cross-host service communication, NATS leafnode config, or podman networking issues
- Planning credential-based authentication for the canonical credential-less `configs/nats/leaf.conf` + `server.conf` (issue #176) and reviewing such a plan for unverified assumptions
- Planning Grafana anonymous-access hardening in `docker-compose.e2e.yml` (issue #206) — disabling `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED`, falling back to admin login, and reviewing the unverified `/api/health` / provisioning assumptions

### Critical Binary Names and Paths

```
CORRECT:  control/ProjectAgamemnon/build/debug/ProjectAgamemnon_server
WRONG:    control/ProjectAgamemnon/build/debug/agamemnon

CORRECT:  control/ProjectNestor/build/debug/ProjectNestor_server
WRONG:    control/ProjectNestor/build/debug/nestor

CORRECT:  PYTHONPATH=src uvicorn hermes.server:app
WRONG:    uvicorn hermes.server:app     (no PYTHONPATH — module not found)
WRONG:    uvicorn hermes.main:app       (module does not exist)

CORRECT:  ~/.local/bin/nats-server -js  (use full path — not in PATH by default)
WRONG:    nats-server -js               (bare name, command not found on most hosts)

NATS:     port 4222 = client pub/sub;  port 8222 = HTTP monitoring
```

### Native Mesh Bringup (single host, pixi available)

```bash
# 1. NATS (binary NOT in PATH — use full path)
~/.local/bin/nats-server -js &

# 2. Agamemnon — build inside pixi for correct conda toolchain
pixi run bash -c "
  cd control/ProjectAgamemnon
  cmake -B build/debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DProjectAgamemnon_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF
  cmake --build build/debug
  ./build/debug/ProjectAgamemnon_server &
"

# 3. Nestor
pixi run bash -c "
  cd control/ProjectNestor
  cmake -B build/debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  cmake --build build/debug
  ./build/debug/ProjectNestor_server &
"

# 4. Hermes — src layout requires PYTHONPATH
cd infrastructure/ProjectHermes
pixi run bash -c "PYTHONPATH=src uvicorn hermes.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8085" &

# 5. Verify
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health    # {"service":"ProjectAgamemnon","status":"ok"}
curl -s http://localhost:8081/v1/health
curl -s http://localhost:8085/health
curl -s http://localhost:8222/varz | python3 -c \
  "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('connections:', d['connections'])"
```

### Multi-Host Cold-Start Strategy (up to 6 Tailnet Hosts)

| Host | Odysseus Present | Strategy | Special Notes |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| titan, aeolus, athena | No | `gh repo clone` + podman containers | Agamemnon build ~5-10 min (Conan C++ deps) |
| artemis | Yes, pixi available | Native build inside `pixi run bash -c "..."` | Must use `-DProjectAgamemnon_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF` |
| hephaestus | No | Clone fresh, native build | Nestor needs `-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS='-lz'` |
| apollo | No | Python 3.7 — too old for Hermes | Use `docker run --network=host` for all services |

**Pre-check**: `ls ~/<project-root>` — clone via `gh repo clone` if missing.

```bash
# Podman container build (hosts without native toolchain)
gh repo clone HomericIntelligence/Odysseus ~/<project-root>
cd ~/<project-root> && git submodule update --init --recursive
podman build -t agamemnon control/ProjectAgamemnon/
podman run -d --name agamemnon --network=host agamemnon
```

**Hermes Dockerfile**: requires `prometheus_client` in pip install; use `HERMES_PORT=8085` (not 8080 — conflicts with Agamemnon). Fixed in PR #415.

### Compose Overlay Pattern for Cross-Host Splits

```yaml
# docker-compose.crosshost.yml (overlay on docker-compose.e2e.yml)
services:
  nestor:
    profiles: ["disabled"]     # runs on control host as native binary
  argus-exporter:
    environment:
      - NESTOR_URL=http://${CONTROL_HOST_IP}:8081
```

```bash
podman compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml -f docker-compose.crosshost.yml up -d
```

**Disable-via-overlay pattern**: `profiles: ["disabled"]` is the correct way to exclude a service from an overlay without removing it from the base compose file.

### NATS Connection Strategy: Direct vs. Leaf Node

| Topology | Recommended | Reason |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 2 hosts, 1 remote client | Direct connection | Zero additional complexity; Tailscale handles routing |
| 2+ hosts, multiple remote clients | Leaf node | Reduces WAN connections; local pub/sub for co-located services |
| Hub-and-spoke (many remotes) | Leaf nodes per spoke | Each spoke gets local NATS; leaf auto-reconnects |

**Leafnode config — critical**: leaf.conf must connect to port **7422** (leafnode listen port), **NOT** port 4222 (client port).

```hcl
# server.conf (hub)
leafnodes { port = 7422 }

# leaf.conf (spoke)
leafnodes {
  remotes [{ url: "nats-leaf://<hub-ip>:7422" }]
}
```

## Proposed Workflow — Planning NATS Leaf/Server Auth (UNVERIFIED, issue #176)

> **Warning:** This section is an UNVERIFIED PLAN. No code was run, no CI passed,
> and the NATS version behaviors below were not exercised. Treat every step as a
> hypothesis until CI confirms. The highest-value content here is the
> reviewer-risk catalogue in **Results & Parameters** — read it before trusting any step.

The canonical `configs/nats/leaf.conf` and `configs/nats/server.conf` ship with NO
authentication: the `leafnodes {}` listener accepts anonymous leaf connections, so any
host that can reach port 7422 can join the mesh and relay traffic. This is the plan for
closing that hole. `configs/` is canonical — fixing it propagates to every host that
copies the config.

### Proposed Steps

1. **Add `authorization {}` to BOTH the client listener AND the `leafnodes {}` listener
   in `server.conf`.** A leafnode listener without its own authorization stays open even
   if the client listener is authed — they are independent. Do not assume top-level
   `authorization {}` covers the leafnode listener.
2. **Add a credential to each `leaf.conf` `remotes` entry.** Prefer
   `credentials = ".../leaf.creds"` (NKey/JWT, per-leaf, individually revocable). A
   `token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"` is an acceptable bootstrap fallback only. **Keep the URL
   on port 7422 — never 4222** (4222 is the client port; leaf remotes pointed at 4222
   silently fail to connect).
3. **Reference secrets via NATS env substitution** (`$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN`), mirroring the
   existing `$NATS_MONITORING_PASSWORD` pattern already in the configs. Never commit
   secret values.
4. **Treat `configs/` as canonical** — the fix lands once and propagates to every host
   that copies or symlinks the config.
5. **Enforce with a fail-closed lint wired into the EXISTING runner/CI gate.** This repo
   is `just` / `pixi`, **NOT** pytest. Add a shell validator invoked by
   `just validate-configs` (which CI must call). The gate **must strip comments before
   grepping** so a commented-out example does not satisfy the check, and it must assert
   per-block (the leafnode block has its own authorization) rather than file-wide.
6. **Auth is a NEW architectural decision → write a NEW append-only ADR (ADR-009).**
   Never edit an accepted ADR.

```hcl
# server.conf — PROPOSED (both listeners authed)
authorization {
  user = "$NATS_CLIENT_USER"
  password = "$NATS_CLIENT_PASSWORD"
}
leafnodes {
  port = 7422
  authorization {                 # leafnode listener needs its OWN block
    token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"     # or per-leaf user/account + .creds
  }
  tls { ... }                     # NOTE: nested block — see awk-parser risk below
}
```

```hcl
# leaf.conf — PROPOSED (authed remote, still port 7422)
leafnodes {
  remotes [
    {
      url: "nats-leaf://<hub-ip>:7422"
      credentials: "/etc/nats/creds/leaf.creds"   # preferred; revocable per-leaf
      # token: "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN"                  # bootstrap fallback only
    }
  ]
}
```

### Canonical Config-Block-Presence Check — Brace-Depth Validator (verified-local, R1)

**This is the validated heart of the R1 plan.** The NOGO killed the first plan because its
validator stopped at the first `}` — which closes the nested `tls {}`, not the `leafnodes {}`
block. A config-block validator MUST track brace DEPTH (count `{` vs `}`), never stop at the
first close brace. Prototyped this session: exit 0 on the fixed fixture, exit 1 on the repo's
current (unauthed) `configs/nats/server.conf`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# validate-configs (wired into `just validate-configs`; CI must invoke it explicitly).
# Extract a named brace-block by DEPTH, stripping comments first, then assert auth inside it.
set -euo pipefail

# block FILE BLOCKNAME -> prints the contents of the first top-level BLOCKNAME { ... },
# tracking nested braces by depth so nested tls{}/jetstream{} do NOT close it early.
block() {
  local file="$1" name="$2"
  sed 's/#.*//' "$file" | awk -v blk="$name" '
    $0 ~ blk"[[:space:]]*\\{" && depth==0 { inblk=1 }
    inblk {
      n=gsub(/\{/,"{"); m=gsub(/\}/,"}");
      depth += n - m;
      print;
      if (depth<=0 && started) { inblk=0 }
      if (n>0) started=1
    }
  '
}

# Assert the leafnodes{} listener carries its OWN authorization{} (per-block, not file-wide).
if ! block configs/nats/server.conf leafnodes | grep -q 'authorization'; then
  echo "FAIL: server.conf leafnodes{} listener has no authorization{} block" >&2
  exit 1
fi
echo "OK: leafnodes listener is authenticated"
```

Verification discipline that makes this gate real (all learned from the NOGO):

```bash
# Assert BOTH directions — a validator that always exits 1 "passes" the bad-case check
# for the WRONG reason and silently rejects the FIX too.
./validate-configs                 # MUST exit 0 on the fixed config
git stash && ! ./validate-configs  # MUST exit 1 on the unfixed config
git stash pop

# Fail-closed must be TESTED, not asserted: render the config with the token UNSET and
# grep for the leaked literal. Install a pinned nats-server in CI and run it unconditionally
# — never gate the check on `command -v nats-server` (that turns it into a silent no-op).
NATS_LEAF_TOKEN= nats-server -t -c configs/nats/server.conf 2>&1 \
  | grep -q '\$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN' && { echo "FAIL: unset token leaked as literal"; exit 1; }
```

### Agamemnon API Shape (Confirmed)

```bash
# Health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health
# Returns: {"service":"ProjectAgamemnon","status":"ok"}

# Create team — response wraps ID under .team.id
TEAM_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/teams \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"my-team","description":"..."}' \
  | jq -r '.team.id')   # NOT .id

# Create task — team-scoped path (NOT /v1/tasks)
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/teams/$TEAM_ID/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"my-task","type":"echo","params":{}}'

# Complete task — echo tasks require external PATCH (no autonomous executor)
curl -s -X PATCH "http://localhost:8080/v1/teams/$TEAM_ID/tasks/<task_id>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status":"completed"}'
```

### Multi-Host Myrmidon Fan-Out

```bash
# On each reachable remote host — always use main.py (Python), NOT main.cpp
NATS_URL=nats://<controller-tailscale-ip>:4222 \
  nohup python3 provisioning/Myrmidons/hello-world/main.py \
  > /tmp/hello-myrmidon.log 2>&1 &

# Verify cross-host NATS connection count
curl -s http://<hub-ip>:8222/varz | jq .connections
```

### NATS JetStream Publish Retry with Exponential Backoff

```python
import asyncio, json, random, time, nats

_RETRYABLE_PUBLISH_ERRORS = (
    nats.errors.TimeoutError,
    nats.errors.NoRespondersError,
    nats.errors.DrainTimeoutError,
    nats.errors.ConnectionReconnectingError,
    nats.errors.StaleConnectionError,
)

async def publish_with_retry(js, subject, message, retries=3, base_delay=0.1, timeout=5.0):
    last_exc = None
    for attempt in range(retries):
        try:
            return await js.publish(subject, message, timeout=timeout)
        except _RETRYABLE_PUBLISH_ERRORS as exc:
            last_exc = exc
            if attempt < retries - 1:
                delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), 2.0) * random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)
                await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    raise last_exc
```

Retry budget defaults (`retries=3`, `base_delay=0.1s`, `timeout=5.0s`): ~15.3s worst case.
Non-retryable errors (`AuthorizationError`, `BadSubjectError`, generic `Exception`) propagate immediately.

### Host-Network Workaround (rootlessport absent)

```bash
# SYMPTOM: start-stack.sh hangs at `podman wait --condition=healthy`
# ROOT CAUSE: rootlessport absent — bridge networking never binds host ports
kill $(cat /run/user/$(id -u)/containers/networks/aardvark-dns/aardvark.pid 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null || true
podman run -d --name hi-nats --network=host nats:alpine -js -m 8222
# When using --network=host, Grafana datasources must use localhost, not service names
```

**Grafana on air-gapped hosts** — add to grafana service to prevent startup hang:

```yaml
environment:
  - GF_ANALYTICS_REPORTING_ENABLED=false
  - GF_ANALYTICS_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES=false
  - GF_ANALYTICS_CHECK_FOR_PLUGIN_UPDATES=false
```

#### Grafana anonymous-access hardening (planning learning, UNVERIFIED, issue #206)

> **Warning:** This subsection is an UNVERIFIED PLAN. No container was run this
> session. The load-bearing untested assumption is that Grafana's `/api/health`
> endpoint stays unauthenticated when anonymous access is disabled — so the e2e
> health probes keep working. Treat every claim as a hypothesis until a runtime
> `up -d grafana` + curl confirms it. Re-grep all cited line numbers before
> editing; they drift.

The Odysseus e2e compose stack ships Grafana with anonymous viewer access enabled.
To CLOSE that (issue #206 asks to *disable*, not downgrade to a lower role):

```yaml
# docker-compose.e2e.yml — grafana service environment (PROPOSED)
environment:
  - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false                     # disable anonymous access
  # REMOVE GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE entirely — it is DEAD config once anon is off
  # With anon off, Grafana falls back to login → MUST supply an admin credential:
  - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=${GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER:-admin}
  - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}
```

**Pattern rules (reusable across HomericIntelligence compose stacks):**

1. To disable anonymous access set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED: "false"` AND **remove**
   `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE` — once anonymous is off the role var is dead config and
   leaving it invites a reviewer to think anonymous is merely downgraded, not disabled.
2. With anonymous off Grafana falls back to its login screen, so the stack MUST provide an
   admin credential. Use env-overridable defaults
   (`${GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER:-admin}` / `${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}`) to keep the e2e
   stack one-command. The `admin/admin` default is a DELIBERATE trade-off — name it
   explicitly so a reviewer can object; it is overridable via env, but the bootstrap default
   can silently become the permanent posture (same shape as the NATS shared-token risk above).
3. **KEY UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION (highest reviewer risk):** Grafana's `/api/health` is
   unauthenticated REGARDLESS of anonymous-access settings, so disabling anon does NOT break
   the e2e health probes (`e2e/run-hello-world.sh`, `run-crosshost-e2e.sh`,
   `run-hermes-hub-e2e.sh`, `e2e/doctor.sh` all curl `:3001/api/health`). This was asserted
   from Grafana docs knowledge, NOT verified in-session. A reviewer/implementer MUST confirm
   at runtime that `/api/health` still returns `database=ok` with anon disabled.
4. **SECOND UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION:** dashboards/datasources are file-provisioned via read-only
   volume mounts (`/etc/grafana/provisioning`), so they do NOT depend on the anonymous API and
   survive the change. Confirm provisioning still loads after login is required.

**Scoping (and its risk):** the plan changes ONLY `docker-compose.e2e.yml` at the Odysseus
root. Evidence: the overlays (`docker-compose.crosshost.yml`, `e2e/docker-compose.*.yml`)
define no grafana service; `build/.worktrees/*` are throwaway; ProjectArgus/ProjectKeystone are
separate submodules out of scope (sibling `provisioning/ProjectKeystone/k8s/grafana.yaml` is a
different deployment surface). The issue names `docker-compose.e2e.yml` at the Odysseus root.
**Reviewer risk:** confirm no other CANONICAL compose file in the Odysseus root re-enables
anonymous Grafana, and that the per-issue submodule boundary is correct.

**Verification discipline — structural compose validation is NOT runtime validation:**

```bash
# compose config passing proves SYNTAX ONLY — it never starts Grafana or probes health.
podman compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml config >/dev/null   # syntax only — NOT proof

# The load-bearing claim (health probe still green with anon off) needs an ACTUAL run:
podman compose -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up -d grafana
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/health    # MUST still return {"database":"ok",...}
# And confirm provisioning survived login-required mode (datasources/dashboards present).
```

Cited line numbers seen once this session (may have drifted — re-grep before editing):
`docker-compose.e2e.yml:154-155` (`GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED`), `:153-159` (anon block),
`:160-162` (admin creds region), sibling `provisioning/ProjectKeystone/k8s/grafana.yaml:95,100-101`,
`docs/e2e-walkthrough-report.md:290`.

### Compose Healthchecks (Dual-Runtime: podman-compose 1.5.0 + Docker Compose v2/v5)

```yaml
# CORRECT — YAML string form; Docker Compose v2 and v5 both treat it as CMD-SHELL
healthcheck:
  test: "wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/v1/health 2>/dev/null || exit 1"
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 3s
  retries: 10
  start_period: 10s

# For nats:alpine (BusyBox wget rejects combined -qO- flag)
healthcheck:
  test: "wget -q -O /dev/stdout http://localhost:8222/healthz 2>/dev/null | grep -q ok"
```

#### Distroless app images — binary self-probe healthcheck (planning learning, unverified)

> **Unverified planning learning (R2, issue #154).** The self-probe pattern below was
> derived from a plan, NOT tested end-to-end. No container was built or observed reaching
> `healthy`. Treat it as the correct distroless-safe shape, but confirm at runtime.

**Rule:** distroless `static`/`base` images (`gcr.io/distroless/static-*`,
`gcr.io/distroless/base-*`) contain ONLY the static binary — **no shell, no wget, no curl,
no busybox**. A `wget`/`curl`/`sh` healthcheck command simply does not exist in the
container, so it fails permanently and the service never reports `healthy`. Compose
healthchecks ALWAYS run inside the container, so there is no shell-free external-tool
option. The ONLY in-container probe is the binary self-checking.

```yaml
# Distroless runtime (gcr.io/distroless/static-*): NO shell/wget/busybox.
# The ONLY in-container probe is the binary self-checking. Requires the app
# binary to expose a -healthcheck flag (localhost GET /healthz, exit 0/1).
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "/argus-dashboard", "-healthcheck"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 15s   # Go/static binaries cold-start; avoid early flapping
```

**Cross-issue coordination note:** the self-probe creates a dependency on the binary owning
a `-healthcheck` flag. When the Dockerfile/binary is delivered by a different issue/PR than
the compose wiring, name that flag explicitly as a blocking note — never assume it exists.

**Verification discipline (do BOTH — structural config validation is insufficient):**

```bash
# Assert the healthcheck does NOT shell out to wget/sh (would fail on distroless)
docker compose config | grep -A4 'healthcheck' | grep -q '/<binary>' && ! (docker compose config | grep -E 'test:.*wget')
# Post-build, assert the container ACTUALLY reaches healthy (config alone is insufficient)

### After NATS Restart

Agamemnon and Nestor do NOT auto-reconnect after NATS restarts. Always kill and restart them:

```bash
pkill -f ProjectAgamemnon_server || kill $(pgrep -f ProjectAgamemnon_server)
pkill -f ProjectNestor_server    || kill $(pgrep -f ProjectNestor_server)
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Leaf.conf to port 4222 | Connected leaf node to NATS client port | Leaf nodes require dedicated leafnode listener port 7422 | Always use port 7422 for leafnode remotes, not 4222 |
| `agamemnon` as binary name | Called `./build/debug/agamemnon` | Binary is `ProjectAgamemnon_server` — exact CMake target name | Check `ls build/debug/` to confirm binary name |
| `nestor` as binary name | Called `./build/debug/nestor` | Binary is `ProjectNestor_server` — exact CMake target name | Always use `ProjectNestor_server` |
| Hermes without PYTHONPATH | `uvicorn hermes.server:app` with no env prefix | src layout — Python cannot find `hermes` module | Always prefix `PYTHONPATH=src` |
| `uvicorn hermes.main:app` | Used `hermes.main:app` entry point | Module is `hermes.server:app`; `hermes.main` does not exist | Always use `hermes.server:app` |
| `nats-server` without full path | Called bare `nats-server` | `~/.local/bin` not in PATH on most remote hosts | Always use `~/.local/bin/nats-server` |
| NATS monitoring on port 4222 | `curl localhost:4222/varz` | Port 4222 is client port; monitoring HTTP is on 8222 | NATS monitoring: port 8222; client pub/sub: port 4222 |
| NATS via podman (slirp4netns) | Podman container NATS without rootlessport | slirp4netns remaps 4222 to ephemeral port invisible to external clients | Run NATS as native binary when rootlessport absent |
| cmake without pixi on artemis | Ran cmake directly without `pixi run bash -c` | pixi conda toolchain not activated; wrong sysroot | Run cmake inside `pixi run bash -c "..."` |
| cmake without `_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF` | Default cmake on artemis | clang-tidy sysroot mismatch causes build failure | Always pass `-DProjectAgamemnon_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=OFF` on conda sysroot hosts |
| Nestor without `-lz` on hephaestus | Standard cmake for Nestor | OpenSSL zlib dep not automatically linked | Pass `-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS='-lz'` on hephaestus |
| `POST /v1/tasks` Agamemnon | Used flat `/v1/tasks` path | Returns 404 — endpoint is team-scoped only | Correct: `POST /v1/teams/<teamId>/tasks` |
| `POST .../complete` task completion | Used POST complete endpoint | Returns 404 — endpoint does not exist | Use `PATCH /v1/teams/<id>/tasks/<id>` with `{"status":"completed"}` |
| `jq -r '.id'` on team response | Extracted `.id` directly | Team ID is nested: `{"team": {"id": "..."}}` | Always use `.team.id` |
| Hermes with `HERMES_PORT=8080` | Default port for Hermes container | Conflicts with Agamemnon on 8080 | Set `HERMES_PORT=8085`; Agamemnon owns 8080 |
| Hermes Dockerfile without `prometheus_client` | Built without prometheus_client | Hermes imports it at startup; container crashes | Add `prometheus_client` to pip install (PR #415) |
| hello-myrmidon `main.cpp` | Used C++ file in hello-world | Requires build step; Python `main.py` is the worker | Always use `main.py`; it subscribes via JetStream push consumer |
| `worker.py` in start-myrmidon recipe | Referenced non-existent worker.py | File does not exist — correct file is `main.py` | Use `main.py`; subscribes to `hi.myrmidon.hello.>` |
| `task.created` to Hermes webhook | Sent `task.created` event | Hermes `_TASK_EVENTS` allowlist: `task.updated`, `task.completed`, `task.failed`, `agent.*` only — silently dropped | Always use `task.updated` for test webhook validation |
| Submodule scripts as-is | Used provisioning/Myrmidons scripts | Submodule pinned to old commit with `aim_*` functions targeting ai-maestro | Verify submodule pins match standalone checkouts after migrations |
| Monolithic e2e-all launcher | Single `just e2e-all` starts everything | Defeats multi-machine flexibility; per-component granularity needed | Individual launchers compose better for distributed deployment |
| `nats:latest` for healthchecks | Used `nats:latest` container | `nats:latest` is distroless — no shell, wget, or curl | Use `nats:alpine` for compose healthchecks |
| CMD-SHELL array healthcheck on podman-compose 1.5.0 | `["CMD-SHELL", "wget ..."]` format | podman-compose 1.5.0 rejects this array format | Use `["CMD", "sh", "-c", "wget ..."]` or YAML string form |
| CMD/CMD-SHELL array on Docker Compose v5 | JSON array `["CMD","sh","-c","full cmd"]` | Docker Compose v5 splits 4th element on spaces — `sh -c wget` runs wget alone | Use YAML string `test: "cmd"` — both v2 and v5 treat it as CMD-SHELL without splitting |
| `wget -qO-` in nats:alpine | Combined short flag with BusyBox wget | BusyBox wget rejects `-qO-`; prints usage and exits 1 | Use `-q -O /dev/stdout` (space-separated, explicit path) |
| Sleeping after final retry attempt | `if attempt < retries` guard | Adds unnecessary latency after retries exhausted | Guard with `if attempt < retries - 1` |
| Catching bare `Exception` in retry | Catch-all in retry loop | Hides non-retryable bugs as transient failures; burns retry budget | Only catch explicit `_RETRYABLE_PUBLISH_ERRORS` tuple |
| No restart after NATS port change | Left Agamemnon/Hermes running | Processes lose NATS connection and do not auto-reconnect | Restart both services after NATS is stable |
| Assuming Odysseus present on all hosts | Skipped `gh repo clone` step | Only some hosts had a clone; others needed fresh clone | Pre-check `ls ~/<project-root>` — clone if missing |
| `podman cp` to overwrite read-only bind-mount | Tried `podman cp` on `:ro` Prometheus config | Volume is `:ro` — copy fails with "device or resource busy" | Write resolved-IP config to host bind-mount source, then `/-/reload` |
| Forking Atlas branch from feature branch | Created feat branch from `feat/issue-22-ci-hardening` | Picked up 12 extra CI commits; PR not rebased to main | Always fork from `main`; check base before `git worktree add` |
| Leaf remote on port 4222 (auth fix) | Pointing `remotes.url` at the client port while adding creds | Leaf nodes silently never connect | Leaf remotes MUST use 7422, even when adding auth |
| Auth only on client listener | Adding `authorization{}` only at the top level of `server.conf` | The `leafnodes{}` listener stays open — anonymous leaf relay still works | The leafnode listener needs its OWN `authorization` block |
| `sensitive = true` in Nomad var | Terraform-ism to hide NATS creds in a Nomad variable | Nomad parse error: "argument named 'sensitive' is not expected" | Don't secure NATS creds via Nomad `sensitive` vars |
| Naive grep gate | `grep` for `token` without stripping comments | A commented-out example passes the check (false-negative) | Strip comments before asserting presence; assert per-block, not file-wide |
| Assuming pytest exists | Planning a pytest-based regression test for the config | Odysseus has no pytest; tasks are `just`-backed | Wire gates into the existing `just` / CI runner |
| awk parser that ends block on first `}` | Validate leafnodes auth by scanning until the first `}` | Nested `tls{}` inside `leafnodes{}` closes first — parser declared a CORRECTLY-authed config unauthenticated; exited 1 on BOTH fixed and broken configs | A config-block validator MUST track brace DEPTH (count `{` vs `}`), not stop at the first `}`. Nested blocks are the norm in NATS/HCL-style configs |
| Verification that only checks the broken case | `git stash && ! validator && echo PASS` | A validator that always exits 1 "passes" this check for the wrong reason — masks that it also rejects the FIX | Always assert BOTH directions: exit 1 on the unfixed config AND exit 0 on the fixed config. A regression gate that can't accept the fix is broken |
| Assuming a recipe wired into justfile runs in CI | Claimed validator "already runs on pull_request via ci.yml" | `ci.yml`'s validate job inlines its own steps and never invokes `just validate-configs`/`pixi run validate` | Don't assume CI calls your `just` recipe — READ the workflow. Add an explicit CI step (or confirm the recipe is invoked) or the gate doesn't exist |
| Parse check gated on `command -v nats-server` | `command -v nats-server && nats-server -t ... \|\| echo skipped` | The tool is absent in CI, so the check silently skips — the fail-closed assumption is never actually tested | If a verification matters, INSTALL the tool in CI (pinned release) and run it unconditionally; a `command -v ... \|\|` guard turns the check into a no-op |
| Asserting `.gitignore` coverage from a pattern | Claimed `/etc/nats/certs/` was already git-ignored | `grep -n "certs\|creds\|nats" .gitignore` → no matches; the claim was fabricated from the certs convention | Grep the actual file before claiming a path is ignored. "It follows the convention" is not evidence the entry exists |
| `wget` healthcheck against a distroless app image | Used `["CMD","wget","-qO-","http://localhost:PORT/healthz"]` (matching sibling services that use slim/alpine images) on a service whose runtime is `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` | Distroless `static` images have NO shell, wget, busybox, or any external tool — the healthcheck command does not exist in the container, so it fails permanently and the container never reports `healthy` | A wget/curl/sh healthcheck is unusable on a distroless runtime. Use a binary self-probe `["CMD","/<binary>","-healthcheck"]`; the app binary must expose a healthcheck flag that does a localhost GET and exits 0/1. Compose healthchecks always run INSIDE the container — there is no shell-free external option |
| Trusting `docker compose config` as proof the healthcheck works | Plan's verification ran `docker compose config` and passed, treated as evidence the service would be healthy | `docker compose config` only validates STRUCTURE/syntax — it never executes the healthcheck command, so a healthcheck pointing at a nonexistent binary (wget in distroless) passes config but fails at runtime | Structural compose validation is NOT runtime validation. For a healthcheck on a distroless image, separately assert the probe does not shell out to wget/sh AND (post-build) assert the container actually reaches `healthy` |
| "matches every existing service" reasoning for healthcheck form | Justified the wget array healthcheck because 4 sibling services use the identical form | The siblings run slim/alpine images (wget present); the new service runs distroless (wget absent) — the convention does not transfer across base-image families | Convention-matching is only valid when the BASE IMAGE family matches. Check the target service's runtime image before copying a sibling's healthcheck |
| Downgrade Grafana anon to Viewer instead of disabling | Kept `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED` on and set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Viewer` | Issue #206 asks to DISABLE anonymous access, not downgrade the anonymous role — anonymous read access still exists | To disable anonymous access set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED: "false"`; downgrading the org role still leaves anonymous access open |
| Left `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE` after disabling anon | Set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false` but kept the org-role var | Once anonymous is off the role var is dead config; it misleads a reviewer into thinking anonymous is only downgraded | REMOVE `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE` when disabling anonymous — it has no effect and obscures intent |
| Disabling Grafana anon without an admin credential | Set `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false` with no `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_*` | With anon off Grafana falls back to the login screen; no usable credential means a locked-out e2e stack | Supply env-overridable admin creds (`${GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER:-admin}`/`${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}`) so the one-command e2e stack still logs in |
| Assuming `compose config` proves the Grafana health probe still works | Ran `compose config` (syntax OK) and treated it as proof `:3001/api/health` survives anon disable | `compose config` validates structure only — it never starts Grafana or curls health; the `/api/health`-unaffected claim is untested | Structural compose validation is NOT runtime validation. Actually `up -d grafana` + curl `/api/health` (expect `database=ok`) before claiming probes survive |

### Uncertain Assumptions a Reviewer MUST Verify (NATS auth plan, issue #176)

This is the core value of the planning learning. A plan for NATS leaf/server auth in this
ecosystem is only as trustworthy as these unverified claims. A reviewer should treat each as
a blocking question, not a settled fact.

1. **Env-var substitution in `authorization { token = "$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN" }` — fail-closed is now
   TESTED, not assumed (R1 downgrade).** Previously the HIGHEST-RISK untested assumption; R1 adds a
   pinned `nats-server -t -c server.conf` run with the var UNSET that greps the rendered config for
   the leaked literal `$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN`. With that CI step the fail-closed behavior is verified, not
   hoped for. The residual risk is keeping that pinned check unconditional (never gate it on
   `command -v nats-server`) so it can't silently skip.
2. **Whether one shared token across client + all leaf nodes is acceptable** vs per-leaf
   `.creds`. A shared token is a shared secret with no per-leaf revocation. The plan documents
   `.creds` as recommended but ships a token fallback; the reviewer must confirm the bootstrap
   token is not silently becoming the permanent posture.
3. **The awk leafnode-block parser brittleness is RESOLVED in R1 by the brace-depth validator.**
   The original NOGO cause: a parser that ends the block on the first `}` closes the nested
   `tls {}`, not `leafnodes {}`, mis-declaring auth. R1 replaces it with the depth-tracking
   `block()` helper (counts `{` vs `}`, strips comments) prototyped this session — exit 0 on the
   fixed fixture, exit 1 on the current configs. Reviewer residual: confirm the validator is run in
   BOTH directions (rejects the bad config AND accepts the fix), never just the bad case.
4. **Cited line numbers may have drifted.** `server.conf:27-34`, `leaf.conf:34-37`,
   `justfile:258-266`, `ci.yml:11-55`, `deployment.md:152-161` were read once. Re-confirm each
   before editing.
5. **ADR-008 Status is "Proposed", not "Accepted".** The plan builds ADR-009 on top of an
   unaccepted ADR. Confirm the sequencing/numbering is still valid.
6. **`.gitignore` coverage of `.creds`/`certs` was FABRICATED in R0 — confirmed absent in R1.**
   `grep -n "certs\|creds\|nats" .gitignore` returns no matches; the R0 claim that the convention
   already ignored these paths was invented. The plan must ADD the `.gitignore` entries, not assume
   them. Lesson: grep the actual file before claiming a path is ignored.
7. **`just validate-configs` running in CI on `pull_request` was FALSE — confirmed in R1.**
   `ci.yml`'s validate job inlines its own steps and never invokes `just validate-configs` /
   `pixi run validate`. The gate does not exist until an explicit CI step is added (or the workflow
   is changed to call the recipe). Read `ci.yml` end-to-end; do not infer the invocation graph.
8. **Shared-token-vs-per-leaf-`.creds` posture risk REMAINS (R1, unresolved).** The plan still
   ships a `token` bootstrap fallback alongside the recommended per-leaf `.creds`. A shared token is
   a shared secret with no per-leaf revocation; the reviewer must confirm the bootstrap token is not
   silently becoming the permanent posture. This is the one reviewer-risk item the R1 prototype did
   NOT retire.

### Reviewer-risk + Meta-Lessons (planning learnings from the NOGO, R1)

These are the durable PLANNING lessons the NOGO cycle taught — independent of NATS specifics.

- **The single most valuable planning move was PROTOTYPING the validator before shipping the
  plan.** Running the brace-depth `block()` extractor against fixed + current fixtures turned "I
  think this works" into "exit 0 vs exit 1, verified." Plans that ship unvalidated shell/awk get
  NOGO'd on latent traps (here: the nested-`tls{}` brace).
- **Verify the CI invocation graph, not just file existence.** A gate wired into a `just` recipe is
  invisible to CI unless the workflow actually calls that recipe. Read `ci.yml` end-to-end.
- **Every line-number citation drifts.** The NOGO flagged `:27-39` vs the actual `:27-40`. Re-grep
  before citing; precision claims invite precision checks.
- **Fail-closed must be TESTED, not asserted.** The highest-risk assumption (unset
  `$NATS_LEAF_TOKEN` resolves empty, not to the literal string) only became believable once a pinned
  `nats-server -t` run was added that greps the rendered config for a leaked literal.
- **Negative-path verification needs BOTH directions.** Asserting only "rejects the bad config"
  hides a validator that rejects everything — including the fix. Assert exit 1 on broken AND exit 0
  on fixed.

**Distroless healthcheck planning lessons (R2, issue #154 — unverified, plan only):**

- **Before copying a sibling service's healthcheck, check the TARGET service's runtime base image.**
  wget/curl/sh healthchecks silently break on distroless (`gcr.io/distroless/static-*` has no
  shell/wget/busybox); the convention only transfers within the same base-image family.
- **`docker compose config` passing is NOT evidence a healthcheck works** — it validates structure,
  never executes the probe. A plan whose only health verification is `compose config` can be green
  while the acceptance criterion ("shows healthy") fails at runtime. Separately assert the container
  actually reaches `healthy` post-build.
- **When the healthcheck binary/flag is owned by a DIFFERENT issue than the compose wiring, the
  self-probe introduces a cross-issue coordination dependency** — name the `-healthcheck` flag
  explicitly as a blocking note, never assume it exists.
- **An issue body's verbatim YAML/code block is a desired end-state, not a guaranteed-correct
  literal** — it may encode a healthcheck that cannot run against the chosen runtime image. Re-derive
  correctness from the actual base image, don't copy blindly. (This generalizes the prior "issue
  snippet ≠ literal diff" lesson already in the skill from the duplicate-recipe learning.)

### Uncertain Assumptions a Reviewer MUST Verify (Grafana anon-access plan, issue #206 — unverified)

No container was run this session; these are blocking questions, not settled facts.

1. **HIGHEST RISK — `/api/health` is unauthenticated regardless of anon settings.** The plan claims
   disabling `GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED` does NOT break the e2e health probes (`e2e/run-hello-world.sh`,
   `run-crosshost-e2e.sh`, `run-hermes-hub-e2e.sh`, `e2e/doctor.sh` all curl `:3001/api/health`). This
   was asserted from Grafana docs knowledge, NOT verified. Confirm at runtime that `/api/health` still
   returns `database=ok` with anon disabled. If false, every health-check-gated e2e phase fails.
2. **Provisioning survives login-required mode.** Dashboards/datasources are assumed file-provisioned
   via read-only `/etc/grafana/provisioning` mounts that do not depend on the anonymous API. Confirm
   provisioning still loads after login is required.
3. **`admin/admin` default posture.** Env-overridable defaults keep the e2e stack one-command, but the
   bootstrap default can silently become the permanent posture (same shape as the NATS shared-token
   risk). Name the trade-off so a reviewer can object.
4. **Scope boundary is correct.** Only `docker-compose.e2e.yml` at the Odysseus root changes. Confirm
   no other CANONICAL root compose file re-enables anonymous Grafana, that the overlays
   (`docker-compose.crosshost.yml`, `e2e/docker-compose.*.yml`) define no grafana service, and that
   ProjectArgus/ProjectKeystone (separate submodules) are correctly out of scope.
5. **`compose config` ≠ runtime proof.** Structural validation passing proves syntax only — it never
   starts Grafana or probes health. The health-probe-still-green claim needs an actual `up -d grafana`
   + curl, not config validation.
6. **Cited line numbers may have drifted.** `docker-compose.e2e.yml:154-155`, `:153-159`, `:160-162`,
   sibling `provisioning/ProjectKeystone/k8s/grafana.yaml:95,100-101`, `docs/e2e-walkthrough-report.md:290`
   were read once. Re-grep before editing.
