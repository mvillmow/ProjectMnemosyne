description: "After git push --force-with-lease (e.g. post-rebase), GitHub Actions marks all in-flight runs on the prior sha as CANCELLED, and these CANCELLED entries appear in the PR's status-check rollup as failure indicators alongside the new sha's runs. PR looks broken even though the current tip's runs are healthy. Use when: (1) a PR shows 50+ failed checks but mergeStateStatus is BLOCKED with mergeable=MERGEABLE, (2) you need to distinguish real failures from rebase-orphaned cancelled runs, (3) deciding whether to manually relaunch or just wait."

# GHA Status Rollup After Force-Push: Distinguishing Real Failures from Cancelled-by-Rebase

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-10 |
| **Objective** | After resolving conflicts on PR #5380 via rebase + `git push --force-with-lease`, the PR appeared to have 50+ failed checks. Diagnose whether these are real failures or stale entries from the prior sha. |
| **Outcome** | All 50+ "failures" were CANCELLED runs from the rebased-out sha (`73691f415`). The current tip (`db8ee2a0f`) had zero `FAILURE` checks — only `success`, `queued`, and `in-progress`. PR was healthy; the GitHub UI's red indicator was misleading. |
| **Verification** | verified-local |

## When to Use

- A PR's status-check page shows many red indicators after a recent rebase / force-push
- `gh pr view <N> --json mergeStateStatus,mergeable` returns `BLOCKED` + `MERGEABLE` (not `DIRTY`)
- You're tempted to "rerun failed jobs" but want to confirm there's anything actually failed first
- You need to filter `gh pr view ... --json statusCheckRollup` to see only real `FAILURE` (excluding `CANCELLED`)

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Get the rollup, broken down by conclusion
gh pr view <PR> --json statusCheckRollup --jq '
  {
    real_failures: [.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion == "FAILURE") | .name],
    cancelled_count: ([.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion == "CANCELLED")] | length),
    in_progress_count: ([.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.status != "COMPLETED" and (.conclusion // "") == "")] | length),
    success_count: ([.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion == "SUCCESS")] | length)
  }'

# Tighter filter: only runs on the current PR tip sha
TIP_SHA=$(gh pr view <PR> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 60 --json databaseId,name,conclusion,status,headSha \
  | jq --arg sha "$TIP_SHA" '
      [.[] | select(.headSha == $sha)]
      | group_by(.conclusion // "queued")
      | map({key: (.[0].conclusion // "queued"), count: length})
    '
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Identify the current tip sha** of the PR with `gh pr view <PR> --json headRefOid`. Anything not on this sha is from a prior force-push and is irrelevant.
2. **Filter the run list** to only entries on that sha. Counts of `success` / `queued` / `in_progress` / `failure` are the real story.
3. **Distinguish "stuck queued" from "true bottleneck."** `gh run list ... --json createdAt` + current UTC time gives queue age. >30 min queued during heavy CI load = expected; >2 hr = stuck, file a runner-availability concern.
4. **Decide action**:
   - `failure` count == 0 + queued only → **wait**, do not rerun (per `feedback_no_ci_retries` in this org's memory).
   - `failure` count > 0 → investigate the named jobs; rerun ONLY if reproducibly clean (gitleaks-flake-on-network class), otherwise root-cause the failure.
   - Many CANCELLED on a sha that's no longer the tip → ignore; they're stale.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Read the PR's UI showing "50+ failed checks" and assumed real test failures | Most of those entries had `conclusion: CANCELLED`, not `FAILURE`. They were from the previous sha that got force-pushed away. UI doesn't distinguish them visually from the current sha's entries. | The rollup mixes runs from ALL commits the PR has had, not just the tip. Filter by sha explicitly. |
| 2 | `gh pr view <PR> --json statusCheckRollup --jq '.statusCheckRollup[] \| select(.conclusion != "SUCCESS")'` | Surfaces CANCELLED, FAILURE, AND in-progress runs as a single bucket — still misleading. | Filter by `conclusion == "FAILURE"` specifically; treat `CANCELLED` as a separate (mostly ignorable) category. |
| 3 | Run `gh run rerun --failed <run_id>` on a workflow whose only failures were CANCELLED-by-rebase | The workflow was already in `queued` (the new sha had auto-triggered new runs). Rerun was a no-op or briefly contended with the auto-triggered run. | After force-push, GHA auto-schedules new workflow runs on the new sha. No manual rerun needed for the new sha. |

## Results & Parameters

```bash
# Quick health check after a force-push
PR=5380
TIP=$(gh pr view $PR --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
gh pr view $PR --json statusCheckRollup,mergeable,mergeStateStatus --jq "{
  mergeable, mergeState: .mergeStateStatus,
  real_failures: [.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion == \"FAILURE\") | .name],
  cancelled: [.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion == \"CANCELLED\")] | length
}"
# If real_failures: [] and mergeable: "MERGEABLE" -> PR is healthy, just wait.
```

Heuristic table:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mergeable: MERGEABLE` + `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` + `real_failures: []` | Healthy, blocked only on in-progress / queued required checks |
| `mergeable: CONFLICTING` + `mergeStateStatus: DIRTY` | Real conflict — rebase needed |
| `mergeable: MERGEABLE` + `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` + `real_failures: [...]` | Real failures — investigate |
| Many `CANCELLED` entries, all on the same non-tip sha | Stale from a force-push, ignore |

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ProjectOdyssey | PR #5380 after rebase to resolve a conflict; appeared to have 50+ failures but all were CANCELLED from the prior sha | Distinguishing CANCELLED-by-rebase from real FAILURE saved a wasteful rerun cycle |
