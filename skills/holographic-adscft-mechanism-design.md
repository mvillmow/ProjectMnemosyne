# Holographic & CTC Mechanism Design (Sci-Fi Physics)

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-01 |
| **Objective** | Design scientifically rigorous (but fiction-licensed) exotic physics computation devices for sci-fi stories; two covered domains: AdS/CFT holographic and Deutsch CTC oracle |
| **Outcome** | Complete mechanism documents written; AdS/CFT defeats 10/14 walls; Deutsch CTC oracle defeats walls 4, 5, 7, 13, 14 with a single physics break (causality) |
| **Verification** | unverified — theoretical design exercise, not implemented |
| **History** | [changelog](./holographic-adscft-mechanism-design.history) |

## When to Use

- Designing a fictional device that simulates reality using holographic physics (AdS/CFT)
- Designing a fictional device that computes via closed timelike curves (Deutsch oracle)
- Grounding sci-fi technology in real physics papers with proper citations
- Needing a structured framework for storytelling science with real math
- Writing mechanism design documents with: one-liner, class, premise correction, how-it-works, laws-broken ledger, 14-walls table, parsimony score, capability score, failure modes, feasibility tags
- Evaluating which of the 14 computational hard walls a mechanism defeats vs. leaves standing

## Verified Workflow

> **Warning (Proposed Workflow):** This workflow has not been validated end-to-end. Treat as a hypothesis until CI confirms. Verification level: `unverified` — theoretical design exercise only.

=== SHARED CONSTANTS ===
Planck length:    ℓ_P ≈ 1.616×10⁻³⁵ m  (THIS is "Planck scale", NOT the Planck constant)
Planck constant:  h = 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s  (NOT what "Planck-level fields" means in sci-fi)
Planck time:      t_P ≈ 5.39×10⁻⁴⁴ s
Planck energy:    E_P ≈ 1.22×10¹⁹ GeV
```

### Detailed Steps — AdS/CFT Domain

1. **Frame the boundary/bulk split:** The device IS the boundary CFT; the simulated reality IS the bulk. Never treat them as separate — they are exactly dual.
2. **Choose RT/HRT surface as the rendering primitive:** Each boundary subregion A has extremal bulk surface γ_A; Area(γ_A) gives entanglement entropy. Bulk geometry = all entanglement entropies (van Raamsdonk).
3. **Apply ADH error-correcting structure:** Boundary-to-bulk map is a quantum error-correcting code (Almheiri-Dong-Harlow 2014). Bulk point p reconstructed from any boundary subregion whose entanglement wedge contains p.
4. **Handle dS vs AdS explicitly:** Our universe is de Sitter (Λ>0); AdS/CFT requires Λ<0. Justify departure: local AdS bubble, or invoke contested dS/CFT (Strominger 2001).
5. **Calculate boundary DoF:** A surface of area A holds at most A/ℓ_P² qubits. 10 cm disk ≈ 3.9×10⁶⁶ cells = capacity ceiling.
6. **State new-physics postulates explicitly and count them:** More postulates = lower parsimony score.

### Detailed Steps — Deutsch CTC Oracle Domain

1. **State the CTC construction mechanism:** Planck-scale wormholes (Morris-Thorne-Yurtsever 1988 at quantum scale) with one mouth time-lagged via negative energy density (Casimir). Requires violating weak energy condition (ρ < 0).
2. **Apply the Deutsch fixed-point condition:** ρ_CTC = Tr_CR [ U (ρ_CR ⊗ ρ_CTC) U† ]. Fixed point always exists by Brouwer's theorem. The CTC subsystem is driven to this fixed point by the *physics of the spacetime*, not by an iterative algorithm. This is the oracle step.
3. **Invoke the Aaronson-Watrous PSPACE result:** The fixed-point computation equals PSPACE. NP-hard problems, #P-hard problems (fermionic sign problem), and computationally irreducible systems are all tractable. Classical and quantum computers with CTC access are equally powerful.
4. **Address the chronology protection conjecture (Hawking 1992):** Quantum vacuum fluctuations diverge on the Cauchy horizon of a CTC-forming spacetime; this likely destroys CTCs before they form. The fiction license must assert that full quantum gravity (unknown) regulates this divergence at Planck scale.
5. **Address fixed-point non-uniqueness:** Deutsch's model guarantees existence but not uniqueness. Non-unique fixed points → ambiguous readout. Design problem encoding to enforce uniqueness, or state as a failure mode.
6. **Address the Bennett linearity trap:** CTC computation does not compose linearly when inputs are mixed states. Practical queries must use pure-state inputs; ensemble/probabilistic inputs fall into the trap.
7. **Score parsimony:** CTCs make ONE primary break (causality); all PSPACE capability cascades from this break with zero additional postulates. Parsimony score ≈ 9/10.

### Universal Mechanism Document Structure (both domains)

```
# MXX — [Name]
One-liner + Class

## Premise Correction
  (Planck CONSTANT vs Planck LENGTH disambiguation — always required)

## How It Works
  (numbered steps with [NEW-PHYSICS] / [REAL] / [SPECULATIVE] tags)

## Real-Science Anchor
  (≥4 real papers with DOI/URL/access date; then "where it departs")

## Laws-Broken Ledger
  (table: Law | Status | How Broken)

## Walls Defeated vs Left Standing
  (all 14 walls; explain HOW each is defeated for walls that are)

## Parsimony Score  (N/10 + one-break cascade explanation)
## Capability Score (N/10 + PSPACE / holographic-bound justification)

## Failure Modes / No-Go Cascades
  (primary physical no-go first; then engineering issues)

## Feasibility Tags
  (requires-X tags, math-is-clean, one-physics-break, etc.)
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Treating AdS/CFT device as a classical simulation | Designing device as a numerical integrator of bulk equations of motion | Misses the point: AdS/CFT says run the boundary CFT and the bulk self-organizes; no explicit bulk integration needed | The device runs boundary physics; bulk geometry is emergent, not computed |
| Ignoring dS/CFT problem | Assuming AdS/CFT applies directly to our universe | Our universe is de Sitter (Λ>0); AdS/CFT requires anti-de Sitter (Λ<0); physically inconsistent | Always state the dS/AdS discrepancy and justify departure explicitly |
| Confusing Planck constant with Planck scale | Using "Planck-level fields" to mean fields with action ~h | "Planck-level" in sci-fi means Planck LENGTH scale (~1.6e-35 m), not h (6.626e-34 J·s) | Always disambiguate; add a premise correction section to every mechanism file |
| Treating CTC fixed-point as an iterative algorithm | Describing the device as "running" the fixed-point equation many times | Misses the key point: a physical CTC enforces the fixed-point condition via spacetime structure — the computation is "already done" in the self-consistent solution | The oracle does not iterate forward; it reads out the self-consistent answer that physics enforces |
| Claiming CTC power exceeds PSPACE | Proposing the device can solve undecidable problems | Aaronson-Watrous (2009) proved exactly: BQP_CTC = BPP_CTC = PSPACE — not more | State capability ceiling as PSPACE; avoid over-claiming |

```

### CTC Oracle — Walls Defeated (detail)

```
Wall 4  (Exponential Hilbert): PSPACE in poly time via fixed-point oracle
Wall 5  (Sign problem): PSPACE ⊇ #P; sign problem tractable
Wall 7  (Irreducibility): CTC fixed-point IS the shortcut; skips step-by-step evolution
Wall 13 (AT²): Not a circuit in causal sense; AT² lower bound does not apply
Wall 14 (Causality): Explicit break; CTC loops are acausal by construction
Wall 12 (Bekenstein): Circumvented — oracle queries, not storage
```

### Parsimony Scoring Guide

```
Score 9-10: Single primary physics break; all capabilities cascade from it
            Example: CTC oracle — one break (causality) → PSPACE
Score 6-8:  2-3 independent new-physics postulates required
Score 3-5:  4-6 independent postulates; each adds sci-fi license cost
Score 1-2:  Many independent breaks required; not plausible even in fiction
