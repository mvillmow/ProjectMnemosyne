# Resolving Canonical Contradictions in Skills

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-05 |
| **Objective** | Establish pattern for fixing skills that teach practices contradicting canonical docs (CLAUDE.md, project standards) |
| **Outcome** | Successful wholesale rewrite of github-actions-python-cicd skill from stale flake8/black/Python 3.8–3.9 to current stack (pixi/ruff/Python 3.10–3.13) |
| **Verification** | verified-local (implemented in ProjectHephaestus issue #720, PR #1014 pending CI) |

## When to Use

- A skill or guide teaches practices contradicting the current CLAUDE.md or canonical standards
- Supporting files (notes.md, references/, examples/) teach the same stale practices as the main file
- Patching individual sections would leave dangerous contradictions elsewhere
- The skill is actively used and its stale guidance could mislead downstream consumers
- The contradictions span multiple dimensions (tooling, versions, patterns, build systems)

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Identify contradictions: skill vs. CLAUDE.md
grep -E "flake8|black|src/|requirements.txt|setup.py" skills/github-actions-python-cicd/SKILL.md
grep -n "^## Language Preference" CLAUDE.md

# 2. Determine scope: is patching sufficient or wholesale rewrite?
# If contradictions span >2 sections, plan for wholesale rewrite

# 3. Find ALL supporting files (not just .md)
find skills/github-actions-python-cicd/ -type f | grep -v .git

# 4. Plan verification commands (map each contradiction to a testable criterion)
# Python 3.8/3.9 removed → grep confirms matrix is 3.10+ only
# flake8 removed → no flake8 tokens anywhere in directory
# src/ layout removed → only "hephaestus/" references in examples

# 5. Delete contradictory supporting files (wholesale removal, not patching)
git rm skills/github-actions-python-cicd/references/notes.md

# 6. Rewrite the main skill file with CLAUDE.md cross-references
# Include quotations: See CLAUDE.md § Language Preference
# Document why EACH choice contradicted the old version

# 7. Verify comprehensively (directory-level, not file-level)
! grep -rnE 'flake8|black|requirements.txt|setup.py|src/' skills/github-actions-python-cicd/
grep -n 'ruff check' skills/github-actions-python-cicd/SKILL.md
grep -n 'python-version.*3\.1[0-3]' skills/github-actions-python-cicd/SKILL.md
pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files skills/github-actions-python-cicd/SKILL.md
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Identify the contradiction**: Diff the skill's recommended practices against CLAUDE.md
   - Read CLAUDE.md § Language Preference and § Python Development Guidelines
   - Note every tool, version, and pattern that differs from the skill
   - Classify: How many sections contradict? (1–2 sections = patch candidate; 3+ = rewrite)

2. **Find ALL supporting files**: Don't assume skill is a single .md file
   ```bash
   find skills/github-actions-python-cicd/ -type f
   # May find: SKILL.md, references/notes.md, examples/, session_log.md, etc.
   ```
   **Every supporting file must be audited** — stale session logs are the most common vector for contradiction persistence.

3. **Plan verification BEFORE editing**: Map each contradiction to a testable criterion
   - Python 3.8/3.9 removed → grep confirms matrix is 3.10–3.13 only
   - flake8 removed → `! grep -rn 'flake8'` returns exit 0 (no matches)
   - src/ layout removed → only "hephaestus/" references in examples
   - requirements.txt removed → `! grep -rn 'requirements'` returns exit 0
   - All changes logged as verification commands (copy-paste ready)

4. **Delete contradictory supporting files**: A stale session log that contradicts CLAUDE.md cannot be "fixed in place"
   - If `references/notes.md` teaches flake8, **delete it entirely** (`git rm`)
   - If `examples/` contains setup.py, **delete it entirely** (`git rm examples/`)
   - Do NOT try to patch — wholesale removal is cleaner and leaves no residue

5. **Rewrite the main skill file**: Use CLAUDE.md sections as the single source of truth
   - Include quotations: `See CLAUDE.md § Language Preference`
   - Document why EACH choice contradicted the old version
   - Add a "Canonical References" section linking back to CLAUDE.md with specific § numbers
   - Explain the consequence of the old practice (e.g., "flake8 doesn't catch unused imports the way ruff does")

6. **Verify comprehensively**: Directory-level verification, not file-level
   ```bash
   # Check ENTIRE directory for stale tokens (critical — catches hidden files)
   ! grep -rnE 'flake8|black|requirements.txt|setup.py|src/' skills/github-actions-python-cicd/
   # Exit 0 ✓ (no stale tokens found)
   
   # Positive match: confirm correct version/pattern is present
   grep -n 'ruff check' skills/github-actions-python-cicd/SKILL.md
   grep -n 'python-version.*3\.1[0-3]' skills/github-actions-python-cicd/SKILL.md
   
   # Format gate
   pre-commit run markdownlint-cli2 --files skills/github-actions-python-cicd/SKILL.md
   ```

7. **Commit with evidence**: Reference the verification commands in commit message
   - Title: `feat: rewrite github-actions-python-cicd skill to match CLAUDE.md stack`
   - Body: List every verification command that passed
   - Rationale: Explain why wholesale rewrite was necessary vs. patching

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Patch individual sections | Replace flake8→ruff in SKILL.md, leave notes.md | references/notes.md still taught flake8; contradiction persisted | Always search entire directory for contradictory files; stale session logs must be deleted |
| Skip directory-wide verification | Only grepped SKILL.md for "flake8\|black" | Missed references/notes.md with same anti-patterns | Verification must cover all files; use `find` + `grep -r` before committing |
| Rewrite without mapping to CLAUDE.md | Updated tool chain but didn't cross-reference docs | Future maintainers couldn't tell why choices changed | Always include CLAUDE.md § section references in the rewritten skill |
| Assume supporting files are auto-generated | Left references/ as-is thinking they were notes | Session logs are human-created and persist after rewrite | Audit supporting directories; delete anything created by human hands that contradicts |
| Verify with inline grep only | Ran `grep flake8 SKILL.md` | Missed `references/notes.md:## Tools to Remove: flake8, black` | Use `-r` flag: `grep -r` not `grep` to catch nested files |

## Results & Parameters

### Applied to issue #720

**Original state**:
- `skills/github-actions-python-cicd/SKILL.md` (438 lines) taught flake8, black, Python 3.8–3.12, requirements.txt, setup.py, src/ layout
- `skills/github-actions-python-cicd/references/notes.md` (stale session log) reinforced the same practices
- Examples used setup.py and src/ layout patterns
- Multiple Python version matrix entries for 3.8 and 3.9

**Rewritten state**:
- SKILL.md (242 lines, −45% bloat) teaches pixi, ruff, mypy, yamllint, Python 3.10–3.13
- Deleted `references/notes.md` entirely (stale session log)
- Deleted contradictory example files (setup.py patterns)
- Added "Canonical References" section with CLAUDE.md § links
- Added "Install Patterns — which to use when" table explaining pixi vs other patterns
- Cross-referenced CLAUDE.md § Language Preference, § Python Development Guidelines, § Version Management, § Common Commands, § Pre-commit Hooks

### Canonical References Template

When rewriting a skill to match canonical docs, include this section:

```markdown
## Canonical References

This skill reflects **ProjectHephaestus CLAUDE.md as the single source of truth** for tooling decisions:

| Topic | CLAUDE.md Section | Verified | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| Language version | § Language Preference (line N) | 2026-06-05 | Python 3.10+ is the floor; no 3.8/3.9 support |
| Linter choice | § Python Development Guidelines (line N) | 2026-06-05 | ruff replaces flake8 + black for speed and coverage |
| Package manager | § Environment Setup (line N) | 2026-06-05 | pixi is the canonical environment manager |
| Test command | § Common Commands (line N) | 2026-06-05 | `pixi run pytest` not pytest directly |
| Precommit hooks | § Pre-commit Hooks (line N) | 2026-06-05 | All hooks managed via `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
```
