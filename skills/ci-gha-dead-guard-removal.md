# CI: GHA Dead Detect-and-Guard Removal

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Goal** | Identify and remove dead detect+guard scaffolding in GHA workflows where the guarded files are always committed, making the detection always produce `skip=false` and all `if:` guards permanently entered |
| **Pattern** | File-presence detect step + downstream `if: steps.detect.outputs.skip == 'false'` guards → unconditional step execution |
| **Output** | Simplified workflow YAML with detect step deleted and all `if:` guards stripped |
| **Language** | YAML (GHA workflow files) — no Python code changes |
| **Build required** | No — pure YAML edit; YAML syntax check is the only local verification needed |
| **Verification** | unverified |

## When to Use

- A workflow contains a step like `detect-pixi` or `detect-justfile` that emits `skip=true` or `skip=false` based on file presence (`[ -f pixi.toml ] && echo "skip=false" || echo "skip=true"`), AND the target file is always committed in the repository.
- Downstream steps guard execution with `if: steps.detect.outputs.skip == 'false'` — making those guards dead (always entered).
- KISS/YAGNI applies: the scaffolding adds complexity with no benefit when the condition can never be false.
- You need to verify whether removing guards is safe (the file might be a reusable template copied to other repos).

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Step 1 — confirm files are committed (not just present on disk)
git ls-files pixi.toml justfile

# Step 2 — check if the workflow is called by other repos
grep -r "uses:.*_required.yml" .github/workflows/

# Step 3 — validate YAML syntax after edit
python3 -c "
import yaml
with open('.github/workflows/_required.yml') as f:
    yaml.safe_load(f)
print('YAML syntax OK')
"

# Step 4 — commit, push, PR
git commit -S -m "ci: remove dead detect+guard scaffolding from pixi-check and justfile-check"
gh pr create --title "ci: remove dead skip-if-absent guards in _required.yml" \
  --body "$(printf 'Remove dead file-presence detect steps and skip guards.\n\nCloses #<issue-number>\n')"
gh pr merge --auto --rebase
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Step 1 — Identify the dead pattern

The pattern is: a detect step emits `skip=true/false` based on file presence, and downstream steps are gated on `if: steps.<id>.outputs.skip == 'false'`.

```yaml
# DEAD PATTERN — detect step always emits skip=false when pixi.toml is committed
- name: Detect pixi
  id: detect-pixi
  run: |
    if [ -f pixi.toml ]; then
      echo "skip=false" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
    else
      echo "skip=true" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
    fi

- name: Install pixi
  if: steps.detect-pixi.outputs.skip == 'false'   # always true; guard is dead
  uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1

- name: Run lint
  if: steps.detect-pixi.outputs.skip == 'false'   # always true; guard is dead
  run: pixi run lint
```

#### Step 2 — Verify the guard is always-entered

The simplest proof — `ls` the target files AND confirm they are tracked by git:

```bash
ls pixi.toml justfile            # confirm they exist on disk
git ls-files pixi.toml justfile  # confirm they are committed (tracked)
```

If both commands show the files, the detect step's output is permanently `skip=false`. No need to trace CI logs or read run history — file presence on disk combined with `git ls-files` is sufficient evidence.

#### Step 3 — Critical: check if the workflow is a reusable template

**Before removing guards**, verify the workflow is NOT intended as a reusable template copied to other repos. If it is, the guards would be load-bearing for repos that lack the guarded files.

```bash
# Check if the workflow is called by other workflows in this repo
grep -r "uses:.*_required.yml" .github/workflows/

# Check for org-wide or cross-repo references
gh search code "uses: <org>/<repo>/.github/workflows/_required.yml" --limit 10

# Check if template/copying documentation mentions this file
grep -r "_required.yml" docs/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null
```

If other repos call this workflow as a reusable workflow, do NOT remove the guards — they protect those repos from failing when the files are absent.

#### Step 4 — Note nuanced double-guards

Some detect steps check multiple file name variants. After removal, the downstream tool will pick up whichever variant exists:

```bash
# Double-guard: checks lowercase AND uppercase
[ ! -f justfile ] && [ ! -f Justfile ]
```

After removing the guard, `just --evaluate` and `just --list` run unconditionally; `just` picks up whichever filename exists (`justfile` or `Justfile`) automatically. This is fine behavior — note the nuance if both variants could coexist.

#### Step 5 — Apply the fix

Delete the entire detect step and remove all `if:` guards that reference it:

```yaml
# BEFORE
jobs:
  pixi-check:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Detect pixi
        id: detect-pixi
        run: |
          if [ -f pixi.toml ]; then
            echo "skip=false" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          else
            echo "skip=true" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          fi
      - name: Install pixi
        if: steps.detect-pixi.outputs.skip == 'false'
        uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
      - name: Run lint
        if: steps.detect-pixi.outputs.skip == 'false'
        run: pixi run lint

# AFTER
jobs:
  pixi-check:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install pixi
        uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
      - name: Run lint
        run: pixi run lint
```

#### Step 6 — Verify YAML syntax

No `pixi run pytest` applies for pure CI workflow edits. YAML syntax check is the correct local verification:

```bash
python3 -c "
import yaml, sys
with open('.github/workflows/_required.yml') as f:
    yaml.safe_load(f)
print('YAML syntax OK')
"
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Guarding removal on CI log inspection | Tried to verify guard is dead by reading CI run history | Unnecessary — file presence + `git ls-files` is sufficient; CI logs do not add information | `ls` + `git ls-files` is the correct, minimal proof that a file-presence guard is dead |
| Removing guards from a reusable workflow without checking callers | Deleted detect steps in a `_required.yml` assumed to be local | If that file is called by other repos via `uses:`, those repos break when their guarded file is absent | Always `grep -r "uses:.*<filename>"` and `gh search code` before removing guards from any reusable/shared workflow |
| Assuming single filename variant | Removed double-guard `[ ! -f justfile ] && [ ! -f Justfile ]` without noting the uppercase form | Capital `Justfile` (which `just` also accepts) would be left unguarded | Note both filename variants; `just` handles either automatically, but document the nuance |

## Results & Parameters

### Typical diff size

Removing detect+guard scaffolding for two jobs (`pixi-check` and `justfile-check`) produces a small, focused diff:

- Delete the entire detect step block (5–10 lines each)
- Remove `if: steps.<id>.outputs.skip == 'false'` from each guarded step (1 line each)
- Net result: 15–25 lines removed, 0 lines added

### YAML syntax verification command

```bash
python3 -c "
import yaml
with open('.github/workflows/_required.yml') as f:
    yaml.safe_load(f)
print('YAML syntax OK')
"
# Expected output: YAML syntax OK
```

### Reusable-workflow check commands

```bash
# Local callers
grep -r "uses:.*_required.yml" .github/workflows/
# Expected: no output (file is not called by other workflows in this repo)

# Org-wide callers
gh search code "uses: <org>/<repo>/.github/workflows/_required.yml" --limit 10
# Expected: no results (file is not a shared reusable workflow)
```
