# Repo Audit: Triage, Fix, and Issue Workflow

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Date** | 2026-05-19 |
| **Objective** | Run a strict repo audit, triage findings by complexity, batch-fix scoped items, and reconcile complex work against the existing GitHub issue backlog before creating focused gaps. |
| **Outcome** | Successful across ProjectMnemosyne and Radiance: one audit cleanup PR pattern, existing issues updated/commented/labeled first, and only missing focused gaps filed as new issues. The skill now includes a finding-verification gate (Phase 1.5) that confirms each CRITICAL/MAJOR finding is true before triage — catching swarm-audit false positives. |
| **Verification** | verified-local |
| **History** | [changelog](./repo-audit-triage-fix-and-issue-workflow.history) |

## When to Use

- You have just run `/repo-analyze-strict` and have a list of graded findings
- The audit was produced by a multi-agent swarm and individual section findings may be factually wrong — you need to verify each finding before acting on it
- You want to separate work that fits in one PR from work that needs its own branch/epic
- You need to map audit findings onto an existing GitHub backlog without creating duplicates
- You want to update/comment/label existing issues before filing only the missing gaps
- You need to clear dead migration scripts, duplicate files, or stale changelog entries
- CI tests are partially broken and you need to scope the test runner to the working subset
- You suspect some test failures are pre-existing (not caused by your changes) and need to verify

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Step 1: Run strict audit
/repo-analyze-strict

# Step 2: Triage findings (see decision criteria below)
# fix-now: <1 hour, no design decisions, self-contained
# file-as-issue: requires design, cross-repo impact, or multi-session work

# Step 3: Batch all independent fixes in parallel tool calls

# Step 4: Verify pre-existing test failures before attributing to your changes
git stash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v 2>&1 | grep -E "PASSED|FAILED|ERROR"
git stash pop

# Step 5: Search/update existing issues before filing gaps
gh issue list --state open --limit 200 --json number,title,labels,url,updatedAt
gh issue list --state all --limit 200 \
  --search "runtime OR healthcheck OR auth OR security OR upload OR dependencies" \
  --json number,title,state,labels,url,updatedAt
gh issue comment 167 --body "Audit update (...): ..."
gh issue edit 167 --add-label bug --add-label priority:P0 --add-label phase:release

# Step 6: Scope CI to working test files only (if needed)
# In workflow YAML, change:
#   run: pytest tests/
# to:
#   run: pytest tests/test_generate_marketplace.py -v

# Step 7: Validate skill files
python3 scripts/validate_plugins.py

# Step 8: Commit, push, open PR with auto-merge
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Phase 1: Run the Audit

Run `/repo-analyze-strict`. This produces a graded report across 15 dimensions. Record:
- Overall score (letter grade + %)
- Per-section grades
- All findings classified as Critical / Major / Minor / Nitpick

#### Phase 1.5: Verify Findings Before Triage

**A swarm-audit finding is a claim, not an observation.** Multi-agent audits dispatch
one Sonnet agent per section (`/repo-analyze-strict-full` runs one agent per audit
section). Individual section agents make confident-sounding factual errors — they can
even miss context they were explicitly given in the dispatch prompt. Acting on a
false-positive finding wastes work, produces misleading commits, or — worst case — runs
a destructive command against a wrong premise.

For **every CRITICAL and MAJOR finding**, before triaging it, run the cheapest read-only
command that confirms or refutes its specific factual assertion:

| Finding shape | Verification command |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| "X is committed to git" | `git ls-files <path>` — empty output = not tracked = false positive |
| "no CI / `.github/` is empty" | `ls` the path the finding names **AND the repo root** — in a monorepo the workflow may live at root, path-scoped to the subproject |
| "file/artifact is missing" | `ls` / `test -f` the path |
| Finding cites a line number | open the file at that line |

Outcomes:

- **Findings that survive verification** proceed to Phase 2 triage.
- **Findings refuted by verification** are downgraded or dropped — and the section grade
  is corrected (a refuted CRITICAL/MAJOR finding usually means the section was graded too
  low).

Note the cost asymmetry: verification is **seconds**; acting on a false positive is
wasted work, a misleading commit, or a destructive command run on a wrong premise. Verify
first, always.

This is the same **trust-but-verify** discipline that the Mnemosyne skill
`tooling-sub-agent-pr-trust-but-verify` applies to sub-agent PR reports — here applied to
sub-agent *audit findings*.

#### Phase 2: Triage Findings

Use these criteria to decide between **fix-now** and **file-as-issue**:

| Criteria | Fix Now | File as Issue |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Time estimate | < 1 hour | > 1 hour |
| Design decisions required | None | Yes |
| Cross-repo or multi-file refactor | No | Yes |
| Requires running tests suite changes | Minor scope | Major restructure |
| Impact if deferred | Low (hygiene) | Low–Medium (can track) |
| Concrete fix known | Yes | Needs investigation |

**Fix-now categories (typical)**:
- Dead scripts / migration artifacts with no callers
- Duplicate files left from refactors
- Missing `requirements.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt`
- Stale `[Unreleased]` changelog sections
- Incorrect CLI usage in docs
- Missing test fixture fields
- `.gitignore` gaps for local config files
- Wrong metadata in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

**File-as-issue categories (typical)**:
- Broken test files importing non-existent modules (requires module creation or deletion + test rewrite)
- Missing type annotations throughout a codebase
- Security hardening (e.g., input validation, sandboxing)
- Major CI matrix expansion
- Architectural restructuring (e.g., monorepo layout changes)

#### Phase 3: Batch-Execute Simple Fixes

Group all independent fix-now items and execute them in parallel tool calls within a single message. This dramatically reduces round-trips:

```
Parallel batch example:
- Edit .gitignore              (independent)
- Delete dead_script_1.py      (independent)
- Delete dead_script_2.py      (independent)
- Edit CONTRIBUTING.md         (independent)
- Edit CHANGELOG.md            (independent)
- Write requirements.txt       (independent)
- Write requirements-dev.txt   (independent)
- Edit tests/conftest.py       (independent)
- Edit .github/workflows/*.yml (independent — but verify test scope first)
```

Only serialize operations that have data dependencies (e.g., read a file before editing it).

#### Phase 4: Verify Pre-Existing Test Failures

Before attributing test failures to your changes, always verify they existed before your edits:

```bash
# Stash your changes
git stash

# Run the full test suite on the unmodified codebase
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v 2>&1 | grep -E "PASSED|FAILED|ERROR|ImportError"

# Restore your changes
git stash pop
```

If failures exist on the stashed (original) codebase, they are pre-existing. Document this in the PR description and scope CI to skip the broken test files.

**Pattern for broken test files that import non-existent modules**:

```bash
# Identify the broken imports
python3 -c "import tests.test_broken_file" 2>&1

# Scope CI to only the working tests
pytest tests/test_working_file.py -v
# Do NOT run: pytest tests/  (picks up broken files)
```

File a GitHub issue for the broken test files rather than deleting them (they may contain valuable test logic once the missing module is created).

#### Phase 5: File GitHub Issues for Complex Items

Before creating issues, search the backlog. Strict audits often rediscover known work.
Use both title lists and broader full-text searches:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 200 \
  --json number,title,labels,url,updatedAt \
  --jq '.[] | "#\(.number)\t\(.title)\t[\([.labels[].name] | join(","))]"'

gh issue list --state all --limit 200 \
  --search "runtime OR healthcheck OR auth OR security OR upload OR dependencies" \
  --json number,title,state,labels,url,updatedAt \
  --jq '.[] | "#\(.number)\t\(.state)\t\(.title)"'
```

Classify each audit finding:

| Audit finding state | Action |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| Existing open issue covers it | Add an audit comment with concrete evidence and any new acceptance detail |
| Existing closed issue regressed | Comment on the closed issue with regression evidence, then open a narrow follow-up |
| Existing issue covers adjacent but not exact scope | Comment to clarify boundary, then open a focused gap issue |
| No issue found | Create a new issue with orchestrator kickoff, evidence, and acceptance criteria |

For each new file-as-issue item, create a GitHub issue with:
- Clear title stating the problem
- Background: what the audit found
- Acceptance criteria: what "done" looks like
- Relevant file paths and error messages
- Label: `technical-debt`, `testing`, `ci-cd`, etc.

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Fix broken test files importing non-existent module" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Background
Two test files import `fix_remaining_warnings` which does not exist...

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Module created or test files deleted and rewritten
- [ ] `pytest tests/` runs clean with no ImportError

## Files Affected
- tests/test_fix_remaining_warnings.py
- tests/test_quick_reference_transform.py
EOF
)" \
  --label "technical-debt,testing"
```

After creating or updating issues, normalize labels so the backlog is filterable:

```bash
gh issue edit 181 \
  --add-label bug \
  --add-label type:validation \
  --add-label area:runtime \
  --add-label priority:P0 \
  --add-label phase:core
```

Read back the final issue list and comment counts:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 50 --json number,title,labels,url \
  --jq '.[] | "#\(.number)\t\(.title)\t[\([.labels[].name] | join(","))]\t\(.url)"'
```

#### Phase 6: Validate and Commit

```bash
# Validate skill/plugin files if any were modified
python3 scripts/validate_plugins.py

# Run scoped tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_generate_marketplace.py -v

# Check git diff for accidental deletions
git diff --stat

# Commit
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "fix: apply audit remediation (dead code, CI, docs, requirements)"
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Run `pytest tests/` in CI | Pointed the CI workflow test step at the full `tests/` directory | Two test files import a non-existent module (`fix_remaining_warnings`), causing `ImportError` collection failure | Always verify full test suite runs clean before setting CI to `tests/`; scope to working subset and file issues for broken files |
| Attribute test failures to own changes | Assumed `ImportError` failures in `test_fix_remaining_warnings.py` were caused by the deletion of migration scripts | Git stash + re-run proved the failures pre-existed | Always stash and re-run before concluding test failures are your fault |
| Fix broken test files in same PR | Tried to fix the broken test imports as part of the cleanup PR | The missing module `fix_remaining_warnings` doesn't exist and creating it is a design decision requiring its own scope | Keep the cleanup PR focused; file a dedicated issue for the broken tests |
| Create a new issue for every audit finding | Treating each strict audit finding as new work without checking the backlog first | Existing issues may already cover the work, and duplicate issues fragment implementation context | Search open and closed issues first; update existing issues and create only focused gap issues |
| Reopen broad closed work for a narrow regression | A closed implementation issue may be related to a new failing behavior | Reopening the broad issue can obscure the exact regression and old acceptance criteria | Comment on the closed issue for traceability, then open a narrow regression follow-up |
| Acted on a swarm-audit MAJOR finding without verifying it | A `/repo-analyze-strict-full` section agent reported `tests/__pycache__/` was committed to git; the plan was to `git rm -r --cached` it | `git ls-files` showed `__pycache__` was never tracked — it existed on disk but was correctly `.gitignore`-excluded. The finding was a false positive | Verify every CRITICAL/MAJOR swarm-audit finding with a single read-only command before triaging it. `git ls-files <path>` settles any "committed to git" claim in one second |
| Trusted a swarm-audit CRITICAL "no CI exists" finding | A section agent reported `.github/workflows/` was empty and there was no CI; the plan was to author a CI workflow | The agent checked only the project-subdirectory `.github/`. The real CI workflow lived at the monorepo-root `.github/workflows/`, path-scoped to the project. CI existed and ran | In a monorepo, a "no CI" finding must be checked against the repo root, not just the subproject. More broadly: a swarm agent can miss context it was even given — verify |

## Results & Parameters

### Swarm-audit false-positive rate (2026-05-19 session)

A 15-section `/repo-analyze-strict-full` run on a predictive-coding research project
produced **2 demonstrable false positives** — roughly **13% of sections** carried at
least one finding that did not survive verification:

- Section 1 (Project Structure): "MAJOR — `tests/__pycache__/` committed to git" —
  refuted by `git ls-files` (untracked, `.gitignore`-excluded). Downgraded to a one-line
  housekeeping note.
- Section 13 (Developer Experience): "CRITICAL — `.github/workflows/` empty, no CI" —
  refuted by `ls` of the monorepo root, where the path-scoped CI workflow actually lived.
  Finding removed; section grade corrected **D+ → C-**.

Both false positives were caught by a **single read-only command** in the Phase 1.5
verification gate, before any triage. The lesson: at least 1-in-8 swarm-audit sections
can carry a finding that would have caused wasted or misleading work if acted on naively.

### Audit Score Baseline (ProjectMnemosyne, 2026-03-28)

| Section | Grade | Key Findings |
| --------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Documentation | B+ | Good README/CHANGELOG, missing ADRs |
| AI Agent Tooling | B+ | Skills marketplace functional |
| Planning/Compliance | B | Issues filed but no roadmap doc |
| Testing | C | 2 broken test files, no coverage enforcement |
| Dependencies | D | No requirements.txt (fixed in this session) |
| Safety | D | No input validation, no sandboxing |

### Changes Applied (10 fix-now items)

**Total**: 14 files changed, ~1,280 net lines deleted

### GitHub Issues Filed (Complex Work)

| Issue | Title | Label |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| #1105 | Fix broken test files (`fix_remaining_warnings`) | testing, technical-debt |
| #1106 | Add type annotations throughout codebase | code-quality |
| #1107 | Security hardening: input validation + sandboxing | security |
| #1108 | Expand CI matrix (Python versions, OS) | ci-cd |
| #1109 | Add ADR directory and document key decisions | documentation |
| #1110 | Enforce test coverage threshold in CI | testing, ci-cd |

### Existing Backlog Mapping Example (Radiance, 2026-04-28)

After a strict Radiance audit, most findings already had issue coverage:

| Audit finding | Existing or New Issue | Action |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| Mutating API endpoints exposed before non-local deployment | #167 | Commented with updated evidence and labels |
| Archive extraction hardening | #168 | Commented to keep archive scope separate from upload boundary |
| Oversized run orchestration module | #171 | Commented that runtime execution wiring should be sequenced with the refactor |
| Dependency lock/constraints strategy | #172 | Commented with container build dependency-resolution evidence |
| Browser/container smoke usability | #173 | Commented with stale container/port diagnostic evidence |
| Coverage gaps | #175 | Commented with new high-value regression targets |
| Healthcheck regression in previously closed hardening issue | #114 and #182 | Commented on closed #114, opened focused #182 |
| Runtime execution not wired into runtime mode | #181 | Opened new focused P0 blocker |
| Upload size enforcement independent of `Content-Length` | #183 | Opened new focused issue |
| User-provided model code execution policy | #184 | Opened new focused issue |

This produced four new focused issues instead of duplicating the entire audit as new tickets.

## Verified On

| Project | Context | Details |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| ProjectMnemosyne | Strict audit + triage + 10-item cleanup PR (March 2026) | 9/9 tests passing, 6 issues filed (#1105–#1110) |
| Radiance | Strict audit issue-backlog reconciliation (April 2026) | Existing open issues were updated/commented/labeled first; only four missing focused issues were created (#181–#184) |
| A predictive-coding research project | `/repo-analyze-strict-full` 15-section swarm audit, 2026-05-19 — 2 section false positives caught by finding-verification gate before triage | A phantom committed `__pycache__` (refuted by `git ls-files`) and a phantom "no CI" (refuted by `ls` of the monorepo root) were both caught before triage; one section grade corrected D+ → C- |
