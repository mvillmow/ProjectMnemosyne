# Worktree Parallel Agent Execution

## Overview

| Field | Value |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Date** | 2026-05-18 |
| **Objective** | Launch N parallel sub-agents in isolated worktrees for parallel issue/PR execution AND single-issue splitting |
| **Outcome** | verified-ci (PRs #1932, #1933 merged from #1887 split); consolidates 5 prior skills; v1.5.0 adds "no-worktree-at-all" anti-pattern from ProjectAgamemnon F-phase (PR #407/#409/#410) |
| **Verification** | verified-ci |
| **History** | [changelog](./worktree-parallel-agent-execution.history) |

Covers launching multiple sub-agents in parallel, each in a dedicated git worktree, to achieve
3-8x speedup on independent work. Includes wave-based dependency management, batch sizing,
rebase-in-parallel patterns, issue triage by complexity, branch collision avoidance, and
**splitting a single multi-part issue into N independent sub-tasks with hot-file ownership**
(v1.1.0).

## When to Use

**Ideal for:**
- Multiple independent issues (3+) — code refactoring, test additions, config changes
- Batch work where issues touch different files/modules (no shared-state conflicts)
- Time-critical sprints (release prep, technical debt, CI unblocking)
- Issues with clear dependency chains (parallelize independent waves)
- Mass-rebasing many PR branches after a large main merge
- **One multi-part issue with 2+ independent remediation items** (use Phase 0 hot-file split)

**Not suitable for:**
- Issues requiring shared state or coordinated changes across files
- Single complex issue requiring sequential reasoning
- Issues touching the same files (high conflict risk) — UNLESS split via Phase 0 hot-file ownership
- More than 2 sub-tasks for a single issue (coordination cost dominates throughput gain)

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Splitting a single multi-part issue into 2 parallel sub-tasks (v1.1.0):
gh issue view <N> --comments  # Survey true remaining scope
gh repo view --json squashMergeAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed,mergeCommitAllowed  # Detect merge policy
grep -E '^\[(feature\.|environments)' pixi.toml  # Discover pixi env names
git worktree add ~/<repo>-worktrees/<issue>-a -b <issue>-a main
git worktree add ~/<repo>-worktrees/<issue>-b -b <issue>-b main
# Dispatch 2 opus sub-agents in parallel (background mode, don't poll)
# After completion, if second PR needs rebase:
cd <second-worktree> && git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
pre-commit run --files <changed>  # MANDATORY after conflict resolution
git push --force-with-lease

# One-shot: launch N agents in parallel with worktree isolation
# (send all Task tool calls in a SINGLE message for true parallelism)

# Rebase all open PRs
gh pr list --state open --json number --jq '.[].number' | \
  while read pr; do gh pr merge "$pr" --auto --rebase; done

# Check PR states after rebase
gh pr list --state open --json number,mergeStateStatus --limit 70 | python3 -c "
import json,sys; prs=json.load(sys.stdin)
by_s={}
[by_s.setdefault(p['mergeStateStatus'],[]).append(p['number']) for p in prs]
[print(f'{s}: {len(n)}') for s,n in sorted(by_s.items())]
"
```

### Phase 0a (v1.2.0): Worktree-Isolation Branch-Namespace Contamination — When Parallel Dispatch BREAKS

**Foundation:** ProjectOdyssey Phase G EASY-tier swarm (PR #5363, 2026-05-09). Eight parallel
haiku/sonnet agents were dispatched with `Task(isolation="worktree")` against eight distinct
issue branches. Multiple agents committed to whichever branch the parent repo's working tree
had checked out, **not** to their own assigned worktree branch. Symptom from sibling agents:

```text
agent-B reports: "please run `git restore CLAUDE.md` — I see stat-cache differences from
                  sibling agents in the parent repo"
```

**Root cause:** `Task isolation=worktree` does NOT fully isolate the git index/HEAD when:

1. Multiple agents share the same parent repository (shared `.git/index` and `.git/HEAD`)
2. Each agent operates on a DISTINCT branch off `main`
3. The parent repo's checked-out branch acts as a "sticky" target — `git commit` from inside a
   sub-worktree can race with the parent's HEAD pointer and land on the wrong branch
4. `git status` in agent-B sees stat-cache deltas left by agent-A's index update

**Why per-sub-task worktree path isolation is necessary but NOT sufficient:**

- Path isolation prevents working-tree file collision (Phase 0 v1.1.0 covers this)
- It does NOT prevent index/HEAD/refs contention when N agents push to N distinct branches
- The contamination window is small (milliseconds) but reproducibly causes wrong-branch commits

**Decision matrix — when to dispatch parallel vs serialize:**

| Scenario | Parallel? | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| EASY-tier 8+ issues, distinct branches | **NO — serialize** | Branch-namespace contention high; consolidate-via-cherry-pick is safer |
| MEDIUM/HARD issues, 1 agent at a time | YES (1 at a time) | Wait for completion before launching next |
| Mass rebase (N agents × M PRs each, agent owns branches) | YES | Each agent's branches are owned end-to-end inside its worktree |
| Single multi-part issue, hot-file ownership | YES (2 agents max) | Phase 0 v1.1.0 pattern still holds |
| Mnemosyne `/learn` parallel skill amendments | **NO — serialize** | Recurring contamination on shared `~/.agent-brain/ProjectMnemosyne` clone |

**Recovery workflow when contamination has already occurred (PR #5363 pattern):**

```bash
# 1. Each worker agent had pushed its branch; the parent repo also had local mess.
# 2. Create a single consolidation branch off main:
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b <epic>-consolidated

# 3. Cherry-pick the GOOD commit from each worker's pushed branch:
for branch in worker-1 worker-2 worker-3 ... worker-8; do
  git fetch origin "$branch"
  git cherry-pick "origin/$branch"
  # resolve any conflict, run pre-commit, continue
done

# 4. Open ONE consolidated PR
gh pr create --title "feat(epic): EASY-tier batch consolidation" \
  --body "Closes #A
Closes #B
Closes #C
..."

# 5. Close the individual worker PRs as "consolidated into #<N>"
for pr in <worker-prs>; do
  gh pr close "$pr" --comment "Consolidated into #<consolidated-pr>"
done
```

**Per-agent-brief mitigation (when parallel IS used):**

Add this hard-stop instruction to every parallel-dispatched agent brief:

```text
CRITICAL — branch-namespace check before EVERY commit:

  CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git -C <my-worktree-path> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "<my-assigned-branch>" ]; then
    echo "ABORT: parent-repo branch contamination detected; current=$CURRENT_BRANCH expected=<my-assigned-branch>"
    exit 1
  fi
  git -C <my-worktree-path> commit ...

Do NOT trust `cd <worktree>` — always pass `git -C <absolute-worktree-path>` to every git
command and verify the branch name before commit/push.
```

### Branch collision hardening (v1.3.0)

**Failure mode (ProjectAgamemnon swarm 2026-05-16):** Four parallel Haiku bundle agents
(Bundles 4, 5, 6, 7) each used `isolation: "worktree"` correctly, so their LOCAL working
trees were separate. But all four followed the same branch-naming template
(`bundle/simple-sweep-N-2026-05-16`) without an issue-number uniqueness guarantee. The result:
26 commits from 4 distinct local branches collapsed onto a single remote branch
(`bundle/simple-sweep-7-2026-05-16`) under one PR (#386), with the PR body listing only
Bundle 7's 10 issues. Recovery required rewriting the PR body to `Closes #N. Closes #M. …`
for all 26 actually-delivered issues and deleting an orphan branch.

**Root cause:** Worktrees share the same remote. `git push -u origin <branch>` from agent A
may land on the same remote ref as agent B if their branch names are identical or if one agent's
push races and overwrites another's. `Task isolation=worktree` guarantees no LOCAL state
contamination, but it does NOT guarantee REMOTE branch uniqueness.

**Fix — two-step hardening (verified 2026-05-16 via PRs #387-#390):**

**Step 1 — Issue-number-suffixed branch names.** Every parallel agent must embed the primary
issue number (and optionally a date) in its branch name to guarantee uniqueness across the wave:

```
# Pattern: <theme>-<issue-number(s)>-<date>
medium/clang-tidy-version-info-177-2026-05-16
medium/cmake-cleanup-182-189-2026-05-16
medium/tsan-preset-185-2026-05-16
medium/version-consistency-script-331-2026-05-16
```

**Step 2 — Mandatory `git ls-remote` collision check inside every agent prompt, BEFORE push:**

```bash
git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <branch> && { echo "FATAL: branch exists on remote"; exit 1; }
git push -u origin <branch>
```

**Hard rule for every parallel-agent prompt:**

```text
CRITICAL — remote branch collision check before push:

  git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <my-branch-name> \
    && { echo "FATAL: branch <my-branch-name> already exists on remote — STOP"; exit 1; }
  git push -u origin <my-branch-name>

If the collision check fails, STOP and report — do NOT retry with a different name.
The orchestrator must diagnose why the branch already exists before proceeding.
```

**Success verification:** After applying v1.3.0 hardening, four parallel Sonnet MEDIUM-Wave-1
agents (issues #177, #182+189, #185, #331) produced four distinct PRs (#387, #388, #389, #390)
with zero branch collisions or PR merges.

### Partial contamination variant (v1.4.0) — one stray commit leaks into another agent's branch

**Distinct from full collapse (v1.3.0).** v1.3.0 covers the failure mode where N parallel
agents' branches collapse onto a single remote ref under one PR. The partial variant is more
subtle: each agent's branch survives as its own PR, but ONE branch's history contains an extra
commit that originated from a sibling agent's work. The diff of the offending PR shows unrelated
changes alongside its intended ones.

**Foundation:** ProjectAgamemnon PR #398 (2026-05-17). Two parallel Haiku bundle agents (#398
and #401) launched with `isolation: "worktree"`. PR #398's intended scope was markdownlint
fixes; the diff included an unrelated `nats_client.cpp` change that actually belonged to
PR #401. Detected by reading the PR diff during review and confirmed via:

```bash
# Show commits on the PR branch beyond main:
git log origin/<branch> ^origin/main --oneline
# Expected N commits (one per intended fix); observed N+1 with one commit touching files
# the agent never declared in scope.
```

**Likely root cause:** A stray `git pull` inside the contaminated worktree (or a branch-pointer
race against the shared origin during near-simultaneous pushes) pulled in a single commit from
the sibling's branch. Unlike (v1.3.0) full collapse, the rest of the branch history was intact.

**Detection signals:**

- PR diff shows files outside the agent's declared scope
- `git log origin/<branch> ^origin/main --oneline` returns more commits than the agent reports
  having authored
- Author/date of the stray commit matches a different in-flight PR's commit
- `git cherry origin/main origin/<other-pr-branch>` shows your branch contains a `+` for
  a commit that belongs to the other PR

**Recovery workflow (verified-ci on PR #398, force-pushed, CI re-ran clean, auto-squash merged):**

```bash
# Inside the contaminated worktree:

# 1. Identify the agent's OWN commits (the ones it intended to make)
git fetch origin main
OWN_SHAS=$(git log origin/main..HEAD --format=%H -- <files-agent-actually-touched>)
# Sanity-check the list: each SHA's `git show --stat` should ONLY touch declared files

# 2. Hard-reset to a clean main
git reset --hard origin/main

# 3. Re-apply ONLY the agent's own commits, oldest-first
echo "$OWN_SHAS" | tac | xargs -I {} git cherry-pick {}

# 4. Force-push with lease (acceptable: the contaminated state was already wrong)
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>

# 5. Re-trigger CI and verify the PR diff now shows ONLY the intended changes
gh pr view <pr-number> --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

**Why `--force-with-lease` not `--force`:** prevents clobbering a legitimate concurrent push
from another agent or human. If the lease fails, STOP and investigate before retrying.

**Failed recovery attempts (don't bother):**

| Attempt | Why It Fails |
|---------|---------------|
| `git revert <stray-sha>` | Leaves the stray commit in history plus a noisy revert commit; PR diff still pollutes review and `gh pr view` still lists the wrong files |
| `git rebase --onto origin/main <stray-sha>~ HEAD` | Works in theory but fragile: if the stray isn't a clean parent boundary, rebase produces conflicts or silently keeps the wrong commit |
| Closing the PR and re-running the agent | Wastes the agent's existing good work; recovery is cheaper than re-execution |

**Prevention (forward-looking):**

- Same v1.3.0 hardening applies — issue-suffixed branch names + `git ls-remote` collision check
- Additionally: tell each agent to NEVER run `git pull` inside its worktree. Use
  `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main` instead, and only when explicitly needed.
- Have the agent verify its own diff scope before push:
  ```bash
  EXPECTED_FILES="<list>"
  ACTUAL_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD)
  diff <(echo "$EXPECTED_FILES") <(echo "$ACTUAL_FILES") || { echo "FATAL: out-of-scope files in diff — STOP"; exit 1; }
  ```

### No-worktree-at-all anti-pattern (v1.5.0) — same workdir, N agents, HEAD-flip contamination

**Companion to** `[[feedback-swarm-branch-collision]]` (full-branch collapse during parallel REMOTE
push). This section covers the LOCAL same-workdir variant: same machine, same checkout, different
agents, NO remote race needed.

**Failure foundation:** ProjectAgamemnon F-phase remediation, 2026-05-18. Three parallel Sonnet
`general-purpose` impl agents were dispatched to implement disjoint features (F-1 PR #407, F-2 PR
#409, F-3 PR #410). Because their FILES were disjoint, the dispatch prompt instructed all three:
"work directly in the main workdir, no worktree, no isolation." Two of three agents reported
HEAD-flipping contamination mid-execution; one agent self-rescued by moving to its own
`/tmp/agamemnon-<phase>` worktree mid-flight.

**Symptoms observed:**

> "The main worktree's HEAD was being concurrently flipped by other agents during the entire
> session (jumping between refactor/orchestration-single-source, fix/dead-code-wiring,
> fix/api-contract-drift). I worked around this with frequent stash/checkout/cherry-pick cycles."

> "Had to repeatedly stash, switch back, and replay commits. At one point another agent's commit
> leaked onto this branch and was then reset off, which also wiped 3 of my commits — I recovered
> them via `git reflog` and replayed onto the correct tip."

**Why "no worktree" feels right but is WRONG for parallel dispatch:**

The instinct to skip worktrees came from two prior known-bad patterns:

1. The harness `isolation: "worktree"` flag creates a SEPARATE CLONE (not a worktree), losing
   visibility into sibling agents' pushed branches and adding setup latency.
2. Parallel-worktree branch collision is a known failure mode (v1.3.0 above).

Both are real, but the alternative — N agents running `git checkout <my-branch>` in the SAME
working tree — is strictly worse: silent HEAD-flip + commit-leak + reset cycles that require
`git reflog` archaeology to recover. The disjoint-files property does NOT protect against shared
`.git/HEAD` and `.git/index` contention.

**Verified workflow (right way to parallelize Sonnet impl agents):**

```bash
# In EACH parallel agent's prompt — explicit per-agent worktree path:
git worktree add /tmp/agamemnon-f1 -b fix/<branch-1> origin/main
cd /tmp/agamemnon-f1
# ...do work, commit, push...
# Cleanup at end:
git worktree remove --force /tmp/agamemnon-f1
```

**Hard rules for the dispatch prompt template:**

```text
1. Use isolated worktree at /tmp/<project>-<phase>. NEVER work in the main workdir.
2. Create the worktree with: git worktree add /tmp/<project>-<phase> -b <branch> origin/main
3. cd into it FIRST before any other git operation.
4. At end of session: git worktree remove --force /tmp/<project>-<phase>
5. Do NOT use the harness `isolation: "worktree"` flag — it creates a separate clone, costs
   setup time, and prevents cross-referencing sibling agents' pushed branches if you need to
   cherry-pick a pattern from a sibling PR.
```

**Decision matrix — workdir strategy by agent type:**

| Scenario | Strategy | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| 2+ parallel Sonnet `general-purpose` impl agents (multi-commit, >5min work) | **Explicit `git worktree add /tmp/<name>` in each prompt** | Disjoint files do NOT protect shared `.git/HEAD`; HEAD-flip cycles waste ~15min/agent |
| Single Haiku fix-agent, <5min, single commit, no other concurrent agents | Main workdir OK | Cost of worktree setup exceeds risk; no concurrency to contend with |
| Multiple agents needing cross-reference to each other's PUSHED branches | Local `git worktree add` (NOT harness `isolation: "worktree"`) | Harness flag creates separate clone — agents lose visibility into sibling branches |
| EASY-tier swarm (8+ Haiku agents, distinct branches) | Serialize OR consolidate-via-cherry-pick | See Phase 0a (v1.2.0) — index/HEAD contention even with `isolation: "worktree"` |

**Detection signals during the run:**

- Agent reports running `git stash` more than once per session
- Agent reports `git checkout` returning to a branch it didn't create
- `git reflog` shows HEAD jumping between branches the current agent doesn't own
- Sibling-agent SHAs appear in `git log HEAD --author=...` output that should be empty

**Recovery if contamination has already happened mid-flight:**

```bash
# 1. Identify your own commits via reflog:
git reflog | grep '<commit-msg-prefix-you-wrote>'

# 2. Hard-reset to clean main:
git reset --hard origin/main

# 3. Cherry-pick your own commits oldest-first onto a fresh branch:
git checkout -b <correct-branch> origin/main
for sha in <your-shas-oldest-first>; do git cherry-pick "$sha"; done

# 4. Then DO move into an isolated worktree before any further work:
git worktree add /tmp/<project>-<phase> -b <correct-branch>-iso HEAD
cd /tmp/<project>-<phase>
```

**Why this is "verified-ci":** All three ProjectAgamemnon F-phase PRs (#407, #409, #410) merged
cleanly to main on 2026-05-18 — but only after each agent independently discovered the
contamination and worked around it (one by moving to its own `/tmp/agamemnon-<phase>` worktree
mid-execution). Total wasted wall-clock: ~15 min/agent. On a subsequent round following these
rules, no contamination occurred.

### Phase 0: Splitting a Single Issue with Shared Docs/Config Files (v1.1.0)

Use this phase when a single multi-part GitHub issue has 2 truly independent remediation items
that you want to land as separate PRs. Foundation: ProjectScylla #1887 split into PRs #1932
(log↔span correlation) and #1933 (span depth + OTLP docs).

**Step 0.1 — Survey the issue's TRUE remaining scope (don't trust the title):**

```bash
gh issue view <N> --comments        # check for "still out of scope" / "partial progress" comments
gh pr list --search "<keywords> in:title" --state merged --limit 10  # see what already landed
```

Foundation work (already-merged scaffold PRs) often shrinks the remaining scope by 50%+.

**Step 0.2 — Build a hot-file ownership matrix BEFORE dispatch:**

| File | Sub-task A | Sub-task B | Rule |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| `cli/main.py` | OWNS | — | Only A may edit |
| `pyproject.toml` | — | OWNS | Only B may edit |
| `docs/dev/<topic>.md` | APPEND-ONLY | APPEND-ONLY | Both append; neither modifies existing sections |
| `<module>/foo.py` | — | OWNS | Only B may edit |

Every file touched by both agents must either have a single owner OR be append-only. Shared
config files (`pyproject.toml`, `pixi.toml`, CI YAML) almost always need single ownership.

**Step 0.3 — Detect repo merge policy ONCE, pass to both briefs:**

```bash
gh repo view --json squashMergeAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed,mergeCommitAllowed
```

If `rebaseMergeAllowed=false`, briefs must use `gh pr merge --auto --squash` — the default
`--rebase` (from CLAUDE.md guidance) will fail.

**Step 0.4 — Detect pixi env names from `pixi.toml` (don't assume `dev`):**

```bash
grep -E '^\[(feature\.|environments)' pixi.toml
# Brief should say "use `pixi run` (default env)" OR list discovered env names
```

**Step 0.5 — Create one worktree per sub-task off latest main:**

```bash
git worktree add ~/<repo>-worktrees/<issue>-<a-name> -b <issue>-<a-name> main
git worktree add ~/<repo>-worktrees/<issue>-<b-name> -b <issue>-<b-name> main
```

**Step 0.6 — Dispatch parallel opus agents in background mode (don't poll):**

Each agent brief MUST include:
- Worktree absolute path (DO NOT cd out of it)
- Verified file paths and line numbers (don't make agent re-discover)
- Hot-file ownership table from Step 0.2
- "Append-only to shared docs" rule
- Detected merge method from Step 0.3 (`--squash` vs `--rebase`)
- Detected pixi env from Step 0.4
- Mandatory `pre-commit run --all-files` before push
- Critical: "Do NOT modify 'still TODO' / 'out of scope' lists in shared docs — the OTHER
  agent's work may obsolete those lines and cause a stale-bullet rebase conflict"

**Step 0.7 — On completion notification, second PR may need rebase:**

```bash
cd <second-worktree>
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
# resolve conflicts (typically end-of-file markdown-lint blank-line issues)
pre-commit run --files <changed-files>   # CRITICAL — see Failed Attempt #14
git add <files> && git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Step 0.8 — Don't auto-clean worktrees** (Safety Net blocks `--force` removal). Either let
the user clean up OR produce a script for them to run.

### Hot-file ownership rules (must be in every brief)

1. ONE owner per shared config file (`pyproject.toml`, `pixi.toml`, `cli/main.py`, CI YAML)
2. Shared docs: APPEND-ONLY — never edit existing sections; add new H2/H3 at end-of-file
3. Each agent's docs append should be small — 20-200 lines max
4. Neither agent may delete bullets from "still TODO" / "out of scope" lists — those may be
   in-scope for the other agent and cause stale-bullet rebase conflicts
5. Run `pre-commit run --files <changed>` AFTER any manual conflict resolution before push

### Why two-agents is the sweet spot for one issue

| Sub-tasks | Coordination cost | Throughput gain | Verdict |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | None | 1x | No split needed |
| 2 | Low (1 hot-file matrix) | ~1.7x | **Sweet spot** |
| 3 | High (3 pairwise matrices) | ~2.0x | Marginal — usually not worth it |
| 4+ | Very high (6+ matrices) | <2.5x | File-conflict risk dominates |

### Phase 1: Plan Wave-Based Execution

Organize issues into dependency waves before launching any agents:

```
Wave 1 (No deps):     #485 + #487  → 1 PR  (quick wins — run immediately)
Wave 2 (Foundation):  #479, #478   → 2 PRs (P0 work — run immediately)
Wave 3 (After W2):    #489, #488   → 2 PRs (depends on #479/#478 merging)
Wave 4 (Independent): #481, #486   → 2 PRs (run immediately)
```

**Key insight:** Waves 1, 2, and 4 can all run concurrently. Wave 3 waits for Wave 2 to merge.

### Phase 2: Issue Triage by Complexity (for large batches)

When processing 10+ issues, classify first with 2-3 parallel Explore agents:

```bash
# Fetch all open issues
gh issue list --repo ORG/REPO --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,body,labels

# Launch 2-3 classification agents in parallel, splitting issues by number range
# Each returns: issue number, title, complexity (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), justification
```

**Classification heuristics:**

```yaml
LOW (< 30 min):
  - Adding entries to .gitignore
  - Creating boilerplate docs (CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, SECURITY)
  - Creating GitHub templates (issue, PR)
  - Pinning action versions to SHA
  - Fixing trailing commas or typos
  - Adding .editorconfig / .pre-commit-config.yaml
  - Removing dead code references
  - Adding simple fields to existing scripts

MEDIUM (1-3 hours):
  - DRY refactoring across 3+ files
  - Adding CI pipeline steps (linting, type checking)
  - Creating JSON schemas
  - Auditing and relocating orphaned files

HIGH (3+ hours):
  - Creating pyproject.toml / pixi.toml (packaging foundation)
  - Building test infrastructure from scratch
  - Tasks with 3+ blocking dependencies
```

**Before launching:** Verify LOW issues don't touch the same files.

### Phase 3: Launch Parallel Sub-Agents with Worktree Isolation

**Critical rule:** Send ALL agent Task tool calls in a SINGLE message for true parallelism.

**Agent instruction template:**

```
Execute [Wave N / Issue #XXX]: [brief description]

CRITICAL: Use a dedicated git worktree to avoid colliding with other agents.

1. Create worktree FIRST:
   git worktree add <project-root>/worktrees/<unique-name> -b <unique-branch>
   cd <project-root>/worktrees/<unique-name>
   (OR use Agent(isolation: "worktree") for automatic management)

2. [Specific implementation steps — include exact file paths, function names, etc.]

3. Run tests: pixi run python -m pytest <test-path> -v
4. Run pre-commit: pre-commit run --all-files
5. Commit: git commit -m "type(scope): description\n\nCloses #XXX"
6. Push: git push -u origin <branch>
7. Create PR: gh pr create --title "..." --body "Closes #XXX"
8. Enable auto-merge: gh pr merge --auto --rebase
9. Report PR URL and status

Do ALL work from inside the worktree. Each agent must use a UNIQUE worktree path and branch.
```

**Required per-agent constraints:**
- Unique worktree directory (e.g., `worktrees/issue-XXX-description`)
- Unique branch name (`<issue-number>-<description>`)
- Detailed, step-by-step instructions (agents have no context of other agents)
- Explicit file paths and line counts where possible

### Phase 4: Mass Rebase with Parallel Agents

For mass-rebasing many PR branches (50-70+ PRs), use batched agents:

```bash
# Check current state
gh pr list --state open --json number,mergeStateStatus,headRefName --limit 70 | python3 -c "
import json,sys
prs = json.load(sys.stdin)
by_state = {}
for p in prs:
    by_state.setdefault(p['mergeStateStatus'],[]).append(p['number'])
for s,n in sorted(by_state.items()):
    print(f'{s}: {len(n)} - {sorted(n)[:10]}')
"

# Enable auto-merge on all PRs missing it
for pr in <list>; do gh pr merge "$pr" --auto --rebase; done
```

**Agent prompt for rebase batches:**

```
CRITICAL: Use a dedicated git worktree to avoid colliding with other agents.

Create your worktree FIRST:
  git worktree add worktrees/rebase-batch-N <stable-branch>
  cd worktrees/rebase-batch-N

Then for each PR in your batch [PR1, PR2, PR3, PR4]:
  git fetch origin <branch> -q
  git switch -c tmp-bN-<pr> origin/<branch> -q
  git rebase origin/main
  # If CONFLICT: git rebase --abort, report PR number for manual resolution
  git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD:<branch> -q
  git switch <stable-branch> -q
  git branch -d tmp-bN-<pr>

When done:
  cd <repo-root>
  git worktree remove worktrees/rebase-batch-N
```

**Optimal batching:**

```yaml
prs_per_agent: 3-4     # Sequential within agent, parallel across agents
agents: 3-4            # All launch simultaneously in one wave
total_prs: 13-70       # Scales well
```

**Temp branch naming (must be unique across agents):**

```
Batch 1 agent:  tmp-b1-<issue>   # e.g., tmp-b1-4833
Batch 2 agent:  tmp-b2-<issue>   # e.g., tmp-b2-4863
Main session:   tmp-<issue>      # e.g., tmp-4889
```

### Phase 5: Handle Branch Conflicts

```bash
# Error: fatal: 'fix-baseline-ci-errors' is already used by worktree at '...'
# Option A: Work in the worktree directly
git stash
cd worktrees/rebase-batch2  # do work here
cd /repo && git stash pop

# Option B: Create a separate worktree for your own work
git worktree add worktrees/main-work origin/my-branch
```

### Phase 6: Resolve Rebase Conflicts Programmatically

**Decision tree for common conflict types:**

| File | Resolution |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `CLAUDE.md`, config files | Take `--ours` always |
| CI workflow YAML | Take `--ours` unless branch is adding the workflow |
| Deleted file (modify/delete) | Honor the deletion with `git rm <file>` |
| Test files | Keep both sides' additions |
| Python scripts | Merge both features when both add distinct functionality |

```python
# Take ours (HEAD/main) — generic helper
def take_ours(content):
    result = []
    in_ours = in_theirs = False
    for line in content.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('<<<<<<<'):
            in_ours = True
        elif line.startswith('=======') and in_ours:
            in_ours = False; in_theirs = True
        elif line.startswith('>>>>>>>') and in_theirs:
            in_theirs = False
        elif in_ours:
            result.append(line)
        elif not in_theirs:
            result.append(line)
    return '\n'.join(result)
```

### Phase 7: Monitor and Merge

```bash
# Monitor progress
gh pr list --state open --json number,mergeStateStatus --limit 70

# Check all PRs for conflicts BEFORE spawning agents
for pr in $(gh pr list --state open --json number --jq '.[].number'); do
  branch=$(gh pr view $pr --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')
  git fetch origin "$branch" 2>/dev/null
  conflicts=$(git merge-tree --merge-base origin/main origin/main "origin/$branch" 2>&1 | grep -c "CONFLICT")
  echo "PR#$pr: $conflicts conflicts"
done

# Verify all issues closed after merge
gh issue list --limit 20 --json number,title,state \
  --jq '.[] | select(.number >= 478 and .number <= 489) | "\(.number): \(.state) - \(.title)"' | sort -n
```

### Alternative: Cherry-Pick Pattern

Instead of each agent creating its own PR, agents commit in worktrees and the main session cherry-picks:

```bash
# Launch agents with isolation: "worktree" — each commits in their worktree
# After all agents complete:

# Stash any uncommitted main work first
git stash push -m "main work" -- file1 file2

# Cherry-pick all worktree commits sequentially
git cherry-pick <hash1> && git cherry-pick <hash2> && git cherry-pick <hash3>

# Resolve any conflicts
# (read conflict markers, edit to resolve, git add, git cherry-pick --continue)

# Run full verification
pixi run pytest tests/ -v
pixi run ruff check <package>/
pixi run mypy <package>/
```

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Sequential agent execution | Launch one agent, wait, then launch next | 10 issues × 3 min = 30 min total; no parallelism benefit | Launch all independent agents in ONE message with multiple Task tool calls |
| Agents working on main branch | Multiple agents working on main or shared branches | Merge conflicts when agents push simultaneously; race conditions on git state | Each agent gets its own worktree in `worktrees/` directory |
| Parallel agents without worktree isolation | Both agents shared the same working tree | Agents left stale rebase-in-progress state (`.git/rebase-merge/`) from each other's abandoned rebases | Always assign each parallel rebase agent a dedicated `git worktree` |
| Overly generic agent instructions | "Fix issues #479, #478, #481 in parallel" | Agents waste time exploring; inconsistent approach | Provide detailed step-by-step with exact file paths, function names, expected line counts |
| 1 PR per agent for 13 PRs | Spawned 13 individual agents | Excessive agent spawn overhead; 5-agent-per-wave limit means 3 waves minimum | Batch 3-4 PRs per agent — 4 agents handle 13 PRs in 1 wave |
| Shared temp branch prefix across agents | Agent 1 and Agent 2 both used `tmp-r2-*` prefix | Agents created conflicting temp branch names | Include unique batch ID in prefix: `tmp-b1-<N>`, `tmp-b2-<N>` |
| Spawned agents while parent was in plan mode | Agents completed analysis but couldn't execute | Plan mode is inherited by sub-agents — they can only read files | Always exit plan mode BEFORE spawning execution agents |
| Content filter on governance doc | Sub-agent tried to write Contributor Covenant text | API content filtering policy blocked output (twice) | Governance/conduct documents may trigger content filters — handle in main session with shorter adapted text |
| Sub-agent retrospective | Asked completed agents to run /learn | Agents are one-shot — context is gone after returning | Sub-agents cannot run follow-up commands; capture learnings from main session instead |
| Branch already exists from failed agent retry | Retry agent tried to create same branch name | Previous failed agent had already pushed the branch | Use `-v2` suffix or delete remote branch before retrying |
| Post-completion error treated as failure | Agents showed `failed` with `classifyHandoffIfNeeded is not defined` | Error occurs AFTER agent completes successfully; it's a cleanup bug | Verify by checking `gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json state` — if MERGED, agent succeeded |
| Cherry-pick of pixi.toml changes | Agent removed `version` line; base had different version | CONFLICT because both sides modified same region | When agents modify shared config files, expect cherry-pick conflicts |
| git stash pop after cherry-picks | Stashed SECURITY.md conflicted with cherry-picked version | Both stash and cherry-pick modified same file | Use `git add` to mark conflict resolution, not `git checkout --` (blocked by safety net) |
| `pixi run -e dev` in agent brief (split-issue dispatch) | Used `dev` env name from instinct/CLAUDE.md convention | Repo had envs `default`/`lint`/`docs`, no `dev` — agent commands failed | Brief should say "use `pixi run` (default env)" OR have agent grep `pixi.toml` for env names FIRST |
| `gh pr merge --auto --rebase` (default from CLAUDE.md) | Standard merge command | Repo had rebase merging disabled — `--rebase` rejected | Detect with `gh repo view --json squashMergeAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed` ONCE, pass to all briefs |
| Both agents append to same docs file end-of-file | Each appended new H2 section at EOF — different lines, "no conflict" | Agent A's PR removed a "still out of scope" bullet that B's work was making in-scope; B's rebase produced stale-bullet conflict | "Append-only to shared docs" is necessary but NOT sufficient — also forbid editing "still TODO"/"out of scope" lists; the other agent may obsolete those lines |
| Trusting local pre-commit pass after manual rebase conflict resolution | Resolved markdownlint conflict, force-pushed without rerunning hooks | Manual edit during conflict resolution introduced missing-blank-line; CI markdownlint failed | Always run `pre-commit run --files <changed>` AFTER manually resolving rebase conflicts, BEFORE force-push |
| Parallel `Task isolation=worktree` on 8 EASY-tier branches (ProjectOdyssey #5363) | Dispatched 8 haiku/sonnet agents simultaneously, each assigned a distinct issue branch | Multiple agents committed to whichever branch the parent repo's working tree had checked out; sibling agents reported `please run git restore CLAUDE.md` from stat-cache deltas | `Task isolation=worktree` is path-isolated but NOT branch/index-isolated when N agents target N distinct branches sharing parent `.git/`. For EASY-tier batches, serialize OR consolidate via cherry-pick into ONE branch (see Phase 0a) |
| Parallel Mnemosyne `/learn` skill amendments | Launched 5 parallel sub-agents to amend 5 different skills on shared `~/.agent-brain/ProjectMnemosyne` clone | Same branch-namespace contamination pattern as ProjectOdyssey #5363; agents wrote to wrong skill files / wrong branches | Serialize `/learn` invocations OR ensure each agent uses a TRULY independent clone (not just a worktree off the shared clone) |
| Parallel Haiku bundle agents (4-7) with `isolation: "worktree"`, no branch-name uniqueness guarantee | Four agents used `isolation: "worktree"` correctly; each pushed its own local worktree branch named `bundle/simple-sweep-N-2026-05-16` | 26 commits from 4 distinct branches collapsed onto a single remote branch `bundle/simple-sweep-7-2026-05-16` under one PR (#386); PR body listed only one bundle's issues, leaving 16 silently fixed-but-unclosed | Worktree isolation guarantees no LOCAL state contamination but does NOT guarantee REMOTE branch uniqueness. Always use issue-number-suffixed names + `git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin <branch>` collision check before push. |
| Parallel Haiku bundle agents (PR #398 + #401) — PARTIAL contamination variant | Two `isolation: "worktree"` agents; PR #398's branch acquired one extra commit from #401's branch (likely stray `git pull` or branch-pointer race during near-simultaneous push) | PR #398's diff showed unrelated `nats_client.cpp` changes alongside its intended markdownlint fixes; `git log origin/<branch> ^origin/main --oneline` returned N+1 commits | Recovery: `git reset --hard origin/main && cherry-pick <own-shas> && push --force-with-lease`. Do NOT try `git revert` (noisy, leaves stray in history) or `git rebase --onto` (fragile). Prevent by forbidding `git pull` in agent worktrees and validating diff scope against an expected-files list before push. See "Partial contamination variant (v1.4.0)" section. |
| 3 parallel Sonnet `general-purpose` impl agents with "work directly here, NO worktree" (ProjectAgamemnon F-phase, 2026-05-18) | Dispatch prompt told all three agents to operate in the main workdir on the assumption that disjoint FILES = safe parallelism | All 3 agents reported workdir HEAD-flipping contamination from sibling `git checkout` operations; one agent's commits leaked into another's branch and had to be recovered via `git reflog`; agents spent ~15 min each in stash/checkout/cherry-pick recovery cycles | Disjoint files do NOT protect shared `.git/HEAD` and `.git/index`. Every parallel impl agent MUST work in its own worktree. Prompt template MUST say "Use isolated worktree at `/tmp/<project>-<phase>`. NEVER work in the main workdir." See v1.5.0 "No-worktree-at-all anti-pattern" section. |
| Harness `isolation: "worktree"` flag for impl agents needing cross-reference visibility | Set `Task(isolation="worktree")` on parallel Sonnet agents who needed to cherry-pick patterns from sibling PRs | Harness flag creates a separate CLONE (not a git worktree), so agents lose visibility into sibling agents' pushed branches; also slower setup | For agents that need to see each other's pushed branches, use explicit `git worktree add /tmp/<name>` inside the prompt instead of the harness flag |

| ProjectScylla #1887 split | 1 issue → 2 PRs (#1932, #1933) | 2 agents | ~30 min wall | ~1.7x |

### Agent Configuration

```python
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    description="Short task description (3-5 words)",
    prompt="""Detailed prompt with worktree instructions...""",
    run_in_background=True  # CRITICAL for parallel execution
)
# OR
Agent(isolation="worktree")  # Automatic worktree management
```

### Worktree Placement Convention

```
<project-root>/worktrees/           # All agent worktrees go here
├── issue-XXX-description/          # Per-issue worktrees
├── rebase-batch1/                  # Rebase batch worktrees
└── rebase-batch2/
```

### Key Branch Protection Settings

Main branch must have:
- Require pull request before merging
- Require status checks to pass
- Enable auto-merge with rebase

This ensures agents cannot push directly to main.
