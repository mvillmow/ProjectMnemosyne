# Planning: Verify Live State Before Assuming Work Remains

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-06-19 |
| **Objective** | When planning an issue that asserts work needs doing (e.g. "5 repos still on master, CI broken"), determine whether that work is already complete BEFORE writing edits — and if it is, produce a verify-and-close plan with zero source changes instead of a rename plan |
| **Outcome** | Successful: live-state verification of GitHub issue #24 ("Standardize default branch name across ecosystem") revealed the migration was ALREADY COMPLETE — all 15 repos default to `main`, no `master` refs exist, all workflows target `main`, all open PRs are based on `main`, all 4 linked tracking issues were already CLOSED. The plan correctly became "verify-and-close, zero source edits." |
| **Verification** | verified-local (the gh/grep commands below were run this session and produced the cited outputs; not validated in ProjectMnemosyne CI) |
| **History** | [changelog](./planning-verify-live-state-before-assuming-work-remains.history) |

## When to Use

- An issue asserts a current state (e.g. "5 repos use master") that you can check directly before planning edits.
- The task premise depends on live GitHub/CI state that drifts after the issue was filed (default branch, CI config, open-PR bases, linked-issue status).
- Before writing any "Files to Modify" list whose entries exist only because the issue said the work was undone.
- Planning a migration, rename, or config-standardization issue that may already have shipped.

## Verified Workflow

The premise of an issue is a snapshot from filing time. Before planning any edit, run the
checks below to establish the LIVE state. If they show the work is done, the deliverable is a
verify-and-close plan (confirm state, close the issue) — not a rename/edit plan.

### Quick Reference

```bash
ORG=HomericIntelligence
REPO=ProjectMnemosyne

# 1. Authoritative default branch (NOT the issue's table)
gh repo view "$ORG/$REPO" --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name

# 2. Prove a branch does NOT exist — list refs, do NOT GET branches/<name>
gh api "repos/$ORG/$REPO/git/refs/heads" --jq '.[].ref'
#   GOTCHA: `gh api repos/$ORG/$REPO/branches/master` returns the DEFAULT
#   branch via HTTP redirect for a missing branch → FALSE POSITIVE.
#   FAIL-LOUD form (clean boolean, emits nothing on API failure):
gh api "repos/$ORG/$REPO/git/refs/heads" --jq 'any(.ref=="refs/heads/master")'
#   Do NOT use `... 2>&1 | grep 'Not Found' || echo 'Not Found'` — it masks
#   auth errors / rate-limits as a false-green "Not Found".

# 3. Workflow triggers still reference the old branch?
grep -rEn "branches:\s*\[?\s*[\"']?(main|master)" .github/workflows/*.yml

# 4. Any open PR based on something other than main?
gh pr list --repo "$ORG/$REPO" --state open --json baseRefName \
  --jq '[.[]|select(.baseRefName!="main")]|length'

# 5. Linked tracking issue states
gh issue view N --repo "$ORG/$REPO" --json state --jq .state
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Confirm the real default branch** with `defaultBranchRef` per repo. Treat this as authoritative
   over any table in the issue body. If it already reads `main`, the rename premise is void for that repo.
2. **Prove the old branch is absent** by listing refs (`git/refs/heads`) and checking that
   `refs/heads/master` is NOT in the output. Do NOT probe `branches/master` — see the Failed Attempts
   table; it redirects to the default branch and falsely implies `master` exists.
3. **Check CI triggers** by grepping `.github/workflows/*.yml` for `branches:` entries. Confirm they
   target `main` and not `master`. A "CI broken because workflows point at master" claim is verifiable here.
4. **Semantically classify each `master` literal before editing.** Not every `master` is a branch ref.
   Distinguish: branch refs (rename candidates) vs. `no-commit-to-branch --branch master` pre-commit
   guards (intentional — leaving `master` here is correct) vs. third-party action pins like
   `action@master` (a version ref to someone else's repo — must NOT be rewritten). Blind find/replace
   corrupts the latter two.
5. **Check open-PR bases** — if zero PRs target anything but `main`, there is no in-flight work
   depending on the old branch.
6. **Check linked/tracking issue states** — if the tracking issues are already CLOSED, the work was
   already accepted and closed out; do not re-plan it.
7. **Run every verification command and paste its REAL output as the expected value.** Never
   annotate a check with a guessed count or boolean — a wrong expected value makes a reviewer
   running the exact command conclude the check FAILED (this round: an asserted grep count of `4`
   was actually `3`; a trailing `# master` comment is not matched by `@master|--branch, master`).
8. **Verify "already-applied" claims by a direct live read, not inference.** A justfile + config
   file is intent, not state. Read the live API (`gh api repos/$ORG/$REPO/rulesets`) — see Results.
9. **Scope the verification loop to the whole population, not just named entities.** If the issue
   is ecosystem-wide ("all repos"), enumerate the full set yourself and loop every check over all
   of it — see the companion skill
   `planning-verify-full-population-not-just-named-entities`. The unnamed members are where residue
   hides (this round: `ProjectKeystone`, not one of the 5 named repos, held the orphan `master`).
10. **Decide the deliverable from the evidence.** If every check shows the work is complete, write a
    forward-looking verify-and-close plan (state the verification commands and their outputs, then the
    single close step) with an explicit "zero source edits" note — not a rename plan, and not a bare
    retrospective status note.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Trust the issue's repo table | Took the issue's "these 5 repos use master" table at face value and started listing rename edits | The table was a stale snapshot; all repos had already migrated to `main` — the rename would have been a no-op against current state | Always verify `defaultBranchRef` live per repo before planning any rename |
| Probe `branches/master` to test existence | `gh api repos/ORG/REPO/branches/master` to check whether a `master` branch still exists | For a missing branch GitHub HTTP-redirects to the default branch and returns 200 with the default branch's data → false positive that `master` exists | Use `gh api repos/ORG/REPO/git/refs/heads --jq '.[].ref'` and check for `refs/heads/master`; absence proves non-existence |
| Blind find/replace master→main | Considered a tree-wide literal `master`→`main` substitution to "do the migration" | Corrupts non-branch uses: `no-commit-to-branch --branch master` guards and third-party `action@master` pins are not branch refs of this repo | Semantically classify every `master` literal; only rewrite actual local branch refs |
| Verify only the 5 named repos | Listed refs for only the 5 repos the issue named as "on master," then declared the ecosystem migration complete | The issue was ecosystem-wide; a 5-of-15 scan structurally cannot find residue in the unnamed 10. `ProjectKeystone` (NOT one of the 5; already defaulting to `main`) still held a stale unprotected orphan `refs/heads/master` — the one real residue | Scope the loop to the full population; see companion skill `planning-verify-full-population-not-just-named-entities` |
| Assert grep count without running it | Annotated a verification step "this grep returns count `4`" from eyeballing the tree | Running it returned `3` — the 4th `master` was a trailing `# master` comment the `@master\|--branch, master` regex cannot match. A reviewer running the command would conclude the check FAILED | Run the verification command and paste its real output as the expected value |
| Fail-green existence check | `gh api .../branches/master 2>&1 \| grep -o 'Not Found' \|\| echo 'Not Found'` to test absence | Masks auth errors / rate-limits / any non-"Not Found" failure as a false-green "Not Found" | Use `gh api .../git/refs/heads --jq 'any(.ref=="refs/heads/master")'` — a clean boolean that emits nothing on API failure |
| Infer ruleset "applied" from config | Claimed branch protection active from `justfile` + `configs/github/org-ruleset.json` | Reviewer rejected inference-as-evidence; config is intent, not live state | Verify already-applied via direct read `gh api repos/ORG/REPO/rulesets` (org-level 404s on FREE plan; repo-level authoritative) |

## Results & Parameters

**Verified outcome for issue #24 (live state, 2026-06-19):**
- All 15 repos: `defaultBranchRef.name == main`.
- No `refs/heads/master` in any of the 5 named repos' ref listings.
- All `.github/workflows/*.yml` triggers target `main`.
- Open PRs based on non-`main`: `0`.
- All 4 linked tracking issues: `state == CLOSED`.
- Correct plan: verify-and-close, **zero source edits**.

**Org plan constraint:** `HomericIntelligence` is on the **FREE** plan, so
`gh api orgs/ORG/rulesets` returns 404/403. Use **repo-level** rulesets
(`gh api repos/ORG/REPO/rulesets`) instead of org-level endpoints.

**Ruleset confirmed by DIRECT live read (2026-06-19), replacing the prior inference:**

```json
{ "name": "homeric-main-baseline", "target": "branch", "enforcement": "active", "id": 15556483 }
```

**Population-scope correction (re-plan after NOGO):** the migration was NOT fully complete.
Extending the ref-listing loop from the 5 named repos to all 15 surfaced one residue:
- `ProjectKeystone` — default already `main` (hence NOT in the named 5), but still carrying a stale
  `refs/heads/master`: `protected == false`, `gh pr list --base master ... --jq length == 0`,
  `compare/main...master` → "No common ancestor" (orphan). Safe to delete via
  `gh api -X DELETE repos/HomericIntelligence/ProjectKeystone/git/refs/heads/master`.

**Companion skill:** `planning-verify-full-population-not-just-named-entities` — scope the
verification loop to the whole population when an issue is ecosystem-wide.

**Residual notes:**
- The closing step (closing issue #24) was specified in the plan but NOT executed by the planner —
  it remains an action for the implementer.
